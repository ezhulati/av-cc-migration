## Alternative Flexible Destination Structure

### Core Structure (All Destinations)

**1. Quick Facts Card** (Visible above fold)

### Template Variations:

**Tier 1: Major Destinations** (Tirana, Saranda)

From "What should we tell them?" to "What do they need to know, when?"

This structure respects both your narrative voice and user needs, allowing stories to breathe while ensuring someone searching "Butrint opening hours" doesn't have to scroll through 2,000 words to find it.
