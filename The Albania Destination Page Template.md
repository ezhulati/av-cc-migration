**The 10-Second Summary** (100 words max)
"Ottoman houses cascade down to the Osum River like white dice thrown by giants. This UNESCO city feeds you lamb stew in stone homes and shows you Byzantine frescoes in a castle where people still live. Come for the architecture, stay for the morning when mist rises off the river and muezzins call from eight different centuries."

### The Philosophy

Each destination page answers four questions in order:

1. **Should I care?** (Hero + Summary)
2. **What would I do there?** (Experience Guide)
3. **Can I make this work?** (Reality Check)
4. **What's next?** (Journey Continues)

Everything else is deleted.
