| medaur-winery | medaur-winery.jpg | 0.03 KB | CDN blocked (403) |

### CDN Block URLs
The following WordPress CDN URLs returned HTTP 403 Forbidden:
- `https://eia476h758b.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Selca_e_Poshtme_Tomb4_Facade2.jpg` (worked around)
- `https://eia476h758b.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tirana_Blloku_from_Sky_Tower-8.00.48 PM.jpg` (worked around)

- `https://eia476h758b.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Medaur_Winery_Nature_Kuqe.jpeg` ❌ Still needed

### Other Findings

**Orphaned Images**: 128 images in the attractions folder that are not referenced by any markdown file. These may be:
- Old versions of images
- Images with WordPress-generated size suffixes (e.g., "image-1024x683.jpg")
- Unused stock photos
- Images referenced in other content types

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Needed

1. **House of Leaves image**:
   - Current size: 84.46 KB (smaller than threshold but exists)
   - Could use a higher resolution version
   - Options:
     - Manual download from WordPress admin panel
     - Use the existing 84KB version (may be acceptable)
     - Find alternative image from Wikimedia Commons

2. **Medaur Winery image**:
   - Current size: 0.03 KB (essentially empty)
   - Must be replaced
   - Options:
     - Manual download from WordPress admin panel
     - Contact winery for official photos
     - Use placeholder image temporarily

### Long-term Actions

1. **Clean up orphaned images**: Review the 128 unused images and delete those that are:
   - Duplicates with different sizes
   - No longer needed
   - Keep high-quality originals

2. **Implement CDN workaround**: For future migrations, consider:
   - Using WordPress application password + authenticated requests
   - Downloading directly from WordPress media library API
   - Using wget/curl with proper user-agent headers

3. **Image optimization**: All downloaded images should be:
   - Converted to WebP format for better compression
   - Resized to appropriate dimensions (max 1920px width)
   - Optimized for web delivery

## Scripts Created

1. **`scripts/fix-broken-attraction-images.js`** - Initial attempt to download from various WordPress URL patterns
2. **`scripts/analyze-broken-featured-images.js`** - Identifies attractions with broken featured images
3. **`scripts/download-from-wordpress-pages.js`** - Fetches images by scraping WordPress attraction pages
4. **`scripts/copy-missing-images.js`** - Copies matching images from posts to attractions folder

## Data Files

- **`data/broken-featured-images.json`** - List of attractions with broken images (updated)
- **`data/attraction-image-fix-report.md`** - This report

---

## Success Rate

**80% Success Rate** (8 out of 10 attractions fixed)

The remaining 2 images are blocked by CDN security measures and will require manual intervention or alternative sources.
