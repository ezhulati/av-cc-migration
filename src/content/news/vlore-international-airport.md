## Albania's Southern Gateway

**Updated: July 2025**

Vlora International Airport (IATA: VLO) is Albania's newest major infrastructure project, positioned to serve as a critical gateway to the country’s booming southern tourism region. Located near the village of Akërni, just north of the coastal city of [Vlorë](https://albaniavisit.com/accommodation/vlora-apartament/), the airport represents a strategic investment in regional connectivity, economic development, and tourism growth.

### Find the Cheapest Flights to Albania

## A New Chapter in Albanian Aviation

First announced in 2019, the Vlora Airport project moved swiftly after the government ended [Tirana International Airport’s ](https://albaniavisit.com/travel-guide/tirana-international-airport/)monopoly on international flights. Ground was broken in late 2021 on a 309-hectare site, formerly a military airfield. After years of work, the airport celebrated its certification flight in May 2025. Full commercial operations are expected by late 2025.

Behind the project is a consortium led by Swiss-Kosovar businessman Behgjet Pacolli, through Mabco Constructions (part of Mabetex Group), with additional contributions from Kosovo’s 2A Group and Turkey’s YDA Group. The concession runs for 35 years under a Build-Operate-Transfer model.

## Terminal and Runway Infrastructure

The airport’s design reflects Albania’s ambition to host a higher volume of international travelers. The runway measures 3,200 meters—long enough for wide-body aircraft such as the Boeing 777 or Airbus A330. A parallel taxiway, multiple aprons, and elevated platforms for flood protection demonstrate careful planning.

Inside the newly expanded 22,000-square-meter terminal, passengers will find a modern layout that supports up to 2 million travelers per year in the initial phase. With modular expansion plans, the airport is built to eventually handle up to 10 million annual passengers.

## Who Will Fly to Vlora?

Air Albania has confirmed plans to relocate its hub operations to Vlora, aiming to establish the airport as a new center of regional travel. While routes are still being finalized, service to major cities in Italy, Germany, Switzerland, and the UK is expected.

Low-cost carriers, such as Ryanair, Wizz Air, and easyJet, have reportedly expressed interest in offering seasonal and year-round services. European tour operators are also lining up charter flights to tap into demand for direct access to the [Albanian Riviera](https://albaniavisit.com/attractions/albanian-riviera/).

## A Strategic Investment for Southern Albania

Vlora Airport isn’t just about moving people—it’s about unlocking economic potential. By reducing travel time to the southern coast by more than three hours, the airport makes places like Sarandë, Himarë, and Butrint far more accessible.

Estimates suggest more than 1,500 jobs will be created directly at the airport, with many more indirectly through tourism, transportation, and local business growth. Foreign direct investment is already following—highlighted by plans for a $1.4 billion resort on nearby Sazan Island.

The airport also serves Albania’s large diaspora community, particularly those living in Italy, Germany, and the UK. Vlora offers a more convenient route home for many families, especially in southern Albania.

## Financial Overview

The original project budget of €104 million has increased to over €140 million due to terminal upgrades and site enhancements. Funding has come almost entirely from the private consortium, with revenue expected to be generated through airline and passenger fees, retail concessions, and cargo operations.

No direct spending from Albania’s national budget was required, though the state contributed land and facilitated permits and access roads.

## Environmental Concerns and Legal Pushback

While the airport is nearing completion, it hasn’t come without controversy. Environmental NGOs, bird protection groups, and EU institutions have raised alarms about the project’s proximity to the Vjosa-Narta Lagoon—a key migratory bird habitat.

Opponents argue that the site contravenes Albania’s obligations under international biodiversity treaties and may compromise bird populations and flight safety. The government, however, insists the airport is built on previously disturbed land and has been elevated to prevent flooding. Officials say flight paths and seasonal scheduling will be adjusted to protect wildlife.

The Bern Convention and the European Commission have both urged Albania to reconsider its location or implement stricter mitigation measures. Legal challenges were filed in 2023 but were unsuccessful in halting construction.

## Outlook

Vlora International Airport is on track to reshape southern Albania’s future. Its success will depend on more than infrastructure—it will require careful management of environmental responsibilities, successful airline partnerships, and a commitment to public benefit.

For travelers, investors, and Albanians abroad, the airport promises shorter journeys and new possibilities. Whether it becomes a true success story depends on what happens after the first planes take off.
