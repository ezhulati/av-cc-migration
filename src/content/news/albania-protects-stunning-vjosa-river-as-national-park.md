Albania, where tourist arrivals nearly doubled last year, is now set to become even more of a hot spot, as the country recently designated one of Europe’s most prominent rivers as a national park.

Environmentalist advocacy has convinced Albanian authorities to protect the rugged, beautiful 168-mile Vjosa River as a reserve. This rare, free-flowing river is poised to draw adventure seekers for hiking, camping, rafting, and more.

Some 1110 species, including the endangered Balkan lynx, call the Vjosa home. This landmark supports tourism and gives ecologically minded travelers a new bucket-list destination.

However, experts warn hydropower development threatens the Vjosa. They petitioned Albania to reassess proposed dams, which could damage ecosystems, increase flooding and erosion, harm agriculture, and raise costs.

Scientists urge a review of hydropower plans and the establishment of an expert panel to inform decisions, supporting Albania's international commitments. Preserving the Vjosa River will maintain its vital biodiversity and heritage.

The new national park balances conservation and tourism. Yet scientifically-guided policies are still key to protecting the Vjosa for the future.
