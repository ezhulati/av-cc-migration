Why Visit

Durres transcends time with over 2,700 years of continuous inhabitation. Greek colonists established the city in 627 BCE and named it Epidamnos.

Its strategic location on the Adriatic brought Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman conquerors, each leaving their unique stamp.

Walk in the footsteps of history at sites like the Roman Amphitheater. Built in the 2nd century CE, it could hold 15,000 spectators for gladiator battles and performances. Though partly ruined by an earthquake, its towering walls still impose.
