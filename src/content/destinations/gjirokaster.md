The Epic Gjirokastër Castle

Towering on a hilltop over town sits Gjirokastër Castle, one of the nation’s most impressive fortresses. Originating in the 12th century, the current grandiose structure took shape during expansions by Ottoman ruler Ali Pasha in the 1800s.

A journey through the castle reveals remnants spanning the epochs, from its medieval citadel remains and Ottoman palace quarters to more recent layers as a WWII siege site and Communist-era prison. The castle grounds also house illuminating museums covering weapons, local arts, photography, and ethnography.

Alongside the fascinating history, the fortress rewards visitors with sublime views over terra cotta rooftops dotted on the mountainside and valley stretches beyond. Its sublime setting makes the challenging uphill trek worthwhile.

Immersing in Ottoman Heritage

Below the castle, Gjirokastër’s beautiful Ottoman-era Old Town immerses visitors in 18th and 19th architecture and ambiance. The houses feature the town’s signature style – gray stone construction with turreted roofs covered in vivid red Turkish tiles.

Winding cobblestoned alleyways thread between these historic dwellings, revealing surprises like the distinctive Zekate houses with their wooden overhanging balconies. Gjirokastër is also filled with handicraft shops specializing in woodcarving, filigree silver jewelry, antiques, and traditional attire.

This remarkably intact old town earned Gjirokastër UNESCO distinction and seemed to transport you to a past era with its quintessential Ottoman essence and community feels.
