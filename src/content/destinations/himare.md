## Why Visit Himarë

Himarë is the kind of place that doesn’t shout for your attention—it doesn’t need to.

Tucked between the rugged Ceraunian Mountains and the inviting blue of the Ionian Sea, Himarë has an easy confidence that comes with centuries of history and layers of cultural identity.

It’s a coastal town where ancient stone houses stand beside sun-drenched beaches and where tradition blends seamlessly with laid-back beach life.

But don’t expect the polished glitz of other Mediterranean spots—Himarë’s appeal is in its imperfections.

The roads are bumpy, the infrastructure a little worn, and time feels like it’s been measured differently here.

This place has survived invasions, empires, and even the whims of modern tourism.

Himarë wears its history proudly, but it won’t cater to every modern traveler’s checklist—and that’s exactly why you should visit.

There’s a rich story behind every old church, crumbling castle, and quiet alley.

The castle on the hill has stood through countless eras, a silent witness to the town’s resilience.

While Himarë may not offer the hustle and bustle of a major city or the overly manicured image of more commercialized resorts, it offers authenticity: real, raw, and unhurried.

Whether exploring its ancient ruins or lounging by the beach with a glass of local wine, Himarë lets you experience Albania's Riviera on its terms—without frills or pretense.

## Top Sights and Activities

### Himarë Castle

The **Himarë Castle** looms over the town, its 3,500-year-old walls telling tales of ancient Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines.

This fortress has seen it all, from the days of Chaonian rule to the **[Byzantine Empire](https://albaniavisit.com/byzantine-era-albania/)** and beyond.

Standing here, you can’t help but feel that the castle is less about grandeur and more about survival—its stones have withstood centuries of war, occupation, and change.

The view from up here is as you’d expect: stunning. The Ionian Sea sprawls out beneath you, and if you squint, you can almost see the ghosts of Venetian traders sailing past.

But don’t expect the castle to have been tidied up for tourists. You’ll navigate crumbling pathways, rough terrain, and a lack of any real signage. It’s not polished, and honestly, that makes it so intriguing.

If you want slick brochures and guided tours, look elsewhere. This is the place if you’re after a genuine feel of what it must have been like to defend these walls centuries ago.

### The Beaches

Himarë isn't just about its castle, though. Its coastline, stretching along the **[Albanian Riviera](https://albaniavisit.com/attractions/albanian-riviera/)**, is the draw for most.

And while Spile Beach is the town’s main strip, the smaller, less-trodden coves stand out.

Places like **Livadhi Beach** and **Filikuri Beach** offer the chance to escape the noise of the promenade, trading in the crowds for a bit of solitude—if you don’t mind pebbles instead of sand.

And yes, let’s be real—these aren’t the pristine, Instagram-ready beaches you might find elsewhere in the Mediterranean.

Himarë’s coastline is rugged. The roads to some beaches are barely more than dirt paths, and finding a patch of shade might involve more effort than you anticipated.

But again, that’s part of the deal here. You come to Himarë because it’s a little rough around the edges, not despite it.

## A Taste of Himarë

Fresh seafood straight from the Ionian, olive oil pressed from nearby groves, and Albanian staples like **tave kosi** (lamb with yogurt) and **byrek** (a flaky pastry filled with spinach or cheese) dominate the menus of the local tavernas.

These are the places where the fish still tastes like the sea, and the wine comes from a vineyard not far from your table.

You won't find fancy wine pairings or complicated fusion dishes here—just food that's honest, hearty, and deeply connected to the land and sea.

## The Evening Stroll

As the sun sets, the locals emerge for **xhiro**, the Albanian evening stroll.

Himarë’s promenade is filled with families, old friends, and visitors, all lazily going up and down the waterfront and chatting about the day.

This walk is an old tradition in Albania, and in a small town like Himarë, it’s the highlight of the evening.

There are no fancy events or must-see attractions—just people walking, talking, and occasionally stopping for an espresso or a scoop of gelato.

If you join them, don’t expect much fanfare. This isn’t a tourist attraction; it’s daily life.

The kind that still moves at its own pace, even as the world around it speeds up.

## Getting There and Around

The drive to Himarë is not for the faint of heart. From **Tirana**, it’s a winding, three-hour coastal road where the views are as jaw-dropping as the hairpin turns.

The road to Ali Pasha Tepelena Castle, also known as Porto Palermo Castle, in Himarë on the Albanian Riviera.

For some, it’s a thrill. For others, it’s terrifying. If you’re uncomfortable behind the wheel, **[hiring a taxi](https://albaniavisit.com/cars/transfers/)** or [hopping on a bus](https://albaniavisit.com/bus/tirana-to-saranda/) might be your best bet.

Once in town, most of Himarë’s highlights are walkable, but you’ll want a car to explore further afield—like the **[Porto Palermo Castle](https://albaniavisit.com/attractions/porto-palermo-castle/)**.

Just be prepared for some bumpy roads and the occasional goat crossing.

## When to Go

**July and August** bring the heat and the crowds, with Himarë’s beaches filling up fast.

**May-June** or **September-October** are your sweet spots if you’re looking for a quieter experience.

The weather is still warm, but the crowds have thinned, and you’ll have more of the beach.

Himarë doesn’t put on airs. It’s not trying to be the next big thing, and that’s precisely its appeal.

It’s a place that has survived millennia without changing too much. It’s a little rough and untamed, but if you’re looking for something real—without the tourist trap gloss—Himarë might be the place you’ve been looking for.
