Why Visit Theth

When most people think of Albania, the first thing that comes to mind is its capital city, Tirana. However, there is much more to this small country than its urban center. Theth is a small village in the northern Albanian Alps. It is a hidden gem, slowly becoming more popular as a tourist destination. 

Every year, tourists worldwide come to Theth to enjoy its natural beauty and peaceful atmosphere. This travel guide will provide all the information about visiting Theth as a tourist. If you’re looking for a place to escape the hustle and bustle of city life, Theth is the perfect spot. Here’s what you need to know before visiting.

Getting to Theth

Theth is best reached by car. It is about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Tirana and takes about 3 hours by car. If you are coming from another country, you can fly into Tirana International Airport and then take a car or bus to Theth.

You should leave early in the morning to give yourself ample time on the winding mountain roads. Several buses run from Tirana to Theth several times a week. The journey takes around three hours.
