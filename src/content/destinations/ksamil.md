A Growing Beach Destination

Once a quiet fishing village, Ksamil has rapidly transformed into a bustling coastal hotspot on Albania’s southern shore.

This evolution is evident throughout the town, from its crowded beaches to its expanding array of accommodations and restaurants, now resembling some well-known Greek islands.

Ksamil Beaches

Ksamil’s primary draw remains its beaches, where the clear, turquoise waters of the Ionian Sea captivate visitors.

However, the beach experience has changed significantly. Beach clubs like Veranda by Apollonia now dominate much of the coastline, offering loungers and umbrellas and bringing a constant soundtrack of electronic, hip-hop, and pop music.

For those seeking a quieter experience, it’s worth exploring beyond the main beaches.

[Pema e Thatë](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/pema-e-thate/) and other less-developed spots can be reached by hiking, short drive, or boat ride.

The beach scene is vivacious during peak season (July and August), with younger travelers and couples dominating the main areas. Families tend to gravitate towards quieter spots.

![Ksamil Albanian Riviera](/images/destinations/Ksamil-1.svg "Ksamil 1")Dining and Nightlife

Ksamil’s dining scene has expanded significantly, offering everything from upscale seafood restaurants to casual pizzerias and traditional Albanian tavernas.

Prices vary widely, with beers costing 3-5 euros, coffees around 2.50 euros, and meals ranging from $8 for a casual lunch to $30 or more for a nicer dinner.

Getting There & Away

Ksamil is located at the southern tip of Albania, 12 km south of Sarandë and just north of the Greek border at [Butrint](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/butrint/). Here’s how to get there.

Most visitors arrive in Ksamil by flying into [Tirana International Airport](https://albaniavisit.com/travel-guide/tirana-international-airport/) or driving a ferry from Corfu to nearby [Saranda](https://albaniavisit.com/accommodation/saranda/).

While improved in recent years, the roads can still be challenging, with narrow lanes and unpaved sections.

Many visitors rent scooters or small cars within Ksamil, but the narrow roads and limited parking make walking a practical option for getting around the town center.
