Why Visit Valbona

Valbona Valley is one of the most striking destinations in Albania, set deep in the Accursed Mountains ([Albanian Alps](https://albaniavisit.com/attractions/albanian-alps/)). Towering limestone peaks rise above pine forests and glacier-fed rivers. This remote region offers nature, stillness, and small-scale tourism rooted in local family life. Whether you want a one-day hike or a multi-day backcountry adventure, Valbona delivers a full alpine experience.

You’ll find rugged beauty, warm hospitality, and just enough infrastructure—without the crowds.

History and Culture

What makes Valbona even more remarkable is what you won’t read in most guidebooks: these peaks were never truly conquered. Unlike the rest of the Balkans, northern Albania’s highlands—including the Valbona Valley—were never fully subdued by the Ottomans. The empire reached the valley in the late 1400s but failed to control it in any meaningful way. Local clans—like the Gashi, Krasniqi, and Kelmendi—retained their autonomy, governed by their own laws and the ancient Kanun code. They paid tribute but kept their weapons, [preserved their language](https://albaniavisit.com/ancient-origin-albanian-language/) and traditions, and defied the empire through [centuries of resistance.](https://albaniavisit.com/albania-under-ottoman-rule/)

In fact, this rugged terrain became a natural fortress. No Ottoman tax officer, soldier, or pasha could command these mountains for long. To this day, the spirit of independence lives on. When you walk these trails, you’re not just hiking through a national park—you’re crossing through one of the last unconquered corners of Europe.

Top Attractions and Things to Do

**[Valbona Valley National Park »](https://albaniavisit.com/attractions/valbona-valley-national-park/)**

Covering over 8,000 hectares, this protected area is home to wildlife like lynx, brown bears, and chamois, as well as old-growth beech and spruce forests. It’s perfect for trail walks, photography, or multi-day trekking.

Valbona–Theth Trail

Albania’s most iconic alpine hike connects Valbonë to Theth via a ~17 km trail that crosses a high pass (1,795 m elevation). You’ll gain about 1,000 m and descend ~800 m. Most hikers complete it in 6–8 hours.

**Best time:** June–September

**Cafés open** near the pass in summer.

**Consider booking the** [Valbonë–Theth hike + transfers](https://getyourguide.tpm.li/vDpzWPNv) to simplify logistics.

*What to expect on the Valbona–Theth trail*

Valbona–Theth Hike Transportation Logistics

**The Valbonë–Theth trail is one-way**—and there is no direct road between the two valleys. If you drive into Valbonë and hike to Theth, your car will be stuck on the wrong side of the mountain range. To retrieve it, you’d have to drive around via Fierza, Kukës, and Shkodër—a 6+ hour journey.

⚠️ **Important:** There is *no drivable road over the Valbona Pass*. Only foot traffic is possible. A 4×4 “off-road” route exists but is pricey (~€120–150), rough, and not recommended for all tourists.

Best Options for One-Way Hikers

**Leave your car in Shkodër.** Many travelers park there and take a van + ferry into Valbonë. After hiking to Theth, return to Shkodër by shared taxi. This loop is the easiest and most scenic.

**Start in Theth.** With the new road, you can now drive to Theth from Shkodër in 2 hours. Hike over the pass to Valbonë, then take the Komani Lake ferry + van back.

**Use a private transfer.** Tour companies offer pickups at either end (~€120–150) if you’re hiking one way with luggage or a rental car plan.

**Out-and-back hike.** Hike to the pass and return to your base—especially if you’ve driven into Theth or Valbonë and want to avoid transport hassles. Start early in the morning if you plan to do this in one day. Keep in mind its 5-6 hours each way so you’re looking at 10-12 hours of hiking in total.

Best Starting Point?

Start in Valbona if you want to take the *famous* [Komani Lake](https://albaniavisit.com/attractions/komani-lake/) *ferry* —a scenic boat ride often called “Europe’s Thailand.” Start in [Theth](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/theth/) if you’re coming from [Tirana](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/tirana/) or driving, as the new paved road makes access easier.

Tips for Your Visit

**Ferry runs May–October.** [Book tickets here](https://komanilakeferry.com) or ask your guesthouse in Shkodër to reserve for you in advance.

✅ **Note:** The site [komanilakeferry.com](http://komanilakeferry.com) is the most widely used and directly manages bookings for both the ferry and transfer combos (bus + ferry + minivan to Valbona).

**Trail fully clears by mid-June.** Snow may block the pass in May and return in October. Check with locals before setting out.

**Theth–Shkodër road is now paved.** Any car can drive it safely in dry weather.

![](/images/destinations/Valbona.jpg)Beyond the Guidebooks

What most visitors don’t realize is that Valbona has layers of history, folklore, and resistance that go far beyond its hiking trails. This valley was once home to an [Illyrian](https://albaniavisit.com/the-illyrians/) settlement and fortress at Rosuja, dating back to the Iron Age. Archaeologists uncovered coins from ancient cities like [Apollonia](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/apollonia/) and [Durrës](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/durres/)—proof that Valbona wasn’t always remote. It was once connected to trade networks long before Albania existed.

Dragobia village contains some of the oldest stone houses in the valley, known as kulla—thick-walled tower homes built for defense. Today, they stand mostly empty or repurposed as guesthouses, silent witnesses to a time when blood feuds and honor codes shaped life in the highlands.

Just outside the valley, the village of Bujan hosted the 1944 Bujan Conference, where Albanian and Kosovar partisans met to decide the political future of Kosovo. And Valbona itself served as the final hideout for national hero Bajram Curri, who died in a cave above Dragobia rather than surrender to King Zog’s forces in 1925. You can still hike to that cave today.

Local legends say this entire valley is guarded by Albania’s spiritual protector, the *“Ora of the Nation.”* According to poet Gjergj Fishta, the Ora watches over Albania from the peaks above Valbona. Folklore also tells of water fairies—Zana—bathing in the pools beneath the Valbona waterfall, giving the glade its mystical energy.

The Accursed Mountains (Bjeshkët e Nemuna) get their name from another legend: that the Devil himself carved the peaks in a single night. Others say the name came from Slavic soldiers who cursed the land while crossing its harsh terrain.

These stories, passed down through oral tradition, make Valbona more than scenic—it’s sacred.
