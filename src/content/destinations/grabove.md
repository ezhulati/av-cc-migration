Why Visit Grabovë

Few Albanian villages feel as untouched yet welcoming as Grabovë, a tiny settlement 5 km southeast of Këlcyrë and about half an hour from the town of [Përmet](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/permet/). Perched at **344 m above sea level** on the sunny side of the Vjosa Valley, it offers stone architecture, farm-to-table meals, and direct access to forest and river trails.

![St Kyriaki (Shën e Diela) Church in Grabovë, Albania](https://eia476h758b.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/St-Kyriaki-Shen-e-Diela-Church.jpg)

St Kyriaki Chapel, Grabovë. Under [communism](https://albaniavisit.com/communist-era/) (1967-1990) locals masked the ruined shrine as a barn and worshipped beneath this 200-year oak; after the regime collapsed they rebuilt the chapel and erected the white cross now visible.

Setting the Scene

The area is renowned for its dramatic landscapes, thermal springs, and rich cultural heritage. The broader region offers splendid views of the Vjosa valley and characteristic villages rich in history and culture[](https://www.visit-gjirokastra.com/package/bike-tour-kelcyre-mbrezhan-grabove-kelcyre/)
