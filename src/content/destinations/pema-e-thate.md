## Why Visit Pema E Thate

Where the Tides of History Meet Paradise

On Albania’s southern shore near [Ksamil](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/ksamil/), on the Ionian Sea, lies Pema e Thatë, a beach with a story as captivating as its beauty.

Despite its name meaning “The Dry Tree,” this coastal gem boasts lush greenery and azure waters that rival any Caribbean paradise.

Yet, beneath its idyllic surface, Pema e Thatë harbors a rich history that runs as deep as its crystal-clear waters.

Getting to Pema e Thatë

Reaching this hidden gem requires a bit of effort, but the journey is part of the adventure:

1.  **Start in Sarandë:** Most visitors begin their journey in [Sarandë](https://albaniavisit.com/accommodation/saranda/), the nearest central town. It’s well-connected to [Tirana by bus](https://albaniavisit.com/bus/tirana-to-saranda/) (about 5 hours) or a short flight to nearby Corfu with a ferry transfer.
2.  **Head to Ksamil:** From Saranda, take a local bus or taxi to [Ksamil](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/ksamil/), which takes about 15 minutes.
3.  **The Final Stretch:** From Ksamil, you have two options:-   **By Road:** Hire a taxi or rent a car for the last 3 km. The road is partially paved and winds through beautiful forest scenery.
    -   **By Sea:** For a more scenic approach, take a boat trip from Ksamil. Many local operators offer this service during the summer months.
4.  **Walking Option:** For the adventurous, hiking from Ksamil is possible. The trail is about 3 km and offers stunning views, but ensure you’re prepared with water and proper footwear.There is no entrance fee to access the beach. For sunbathers, beach chairs and umbrellas are available for rent.

Prices can vary depending on the season, ranging from $10 to $40 per day for a set of two chairs and an umbrella.

It’s advisable to bring cash, as card facilities may be limited.

Best Time to Visit:** Late spring (May-June) or early autumn (September-October) offer pleasant weather and fewer crowds. Summer (July-August) is busiest but perfect for beach activities.

Parking:** Parking is free.

**Amenities and Facilities:** Pema e Thatë offers more facilities than you might expect for a secluded beach. There’s a pizzeria on-site for those craving a slice of Italy by the Ionian Sea. Additionally, a beach cafe serves several food and drinks, allowing you to stay refreshed throughout your visit.

Tip:** While there are food and drink options available, it’s still a good idea to bring some of your snacks, water, and beach essentials. This gives you more flexibility, especially if you explore beyond the immediate beach area.

A Coastline Shaped by Centuries

At first glance, Pema e Thatë’s pebbled shoreline resembles many other beaches along the [Albanian Riviera](https://albaniavisit.com/attractions/albanian-riviera/).

However, you’ll notice something different once you enter the water. The sea floor is covered in soft sand. This unexpected change in texture surprised me.

Online articles report that this sand may not be natural, suggesting beach operators added it to enhance the swimming experience and the blue color of the water.

Regardless of the sand’s origin, Pema e Thatë, like much of this coastline, has a rich history.

Over the centuries, the area has seen the rise and fall of various civilizations, adding an intriguing historical dimension to its natural beauty.

Nearby, the ancient city of [Butrint](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/butrint/), now a [UNESCO World Heritage site](https://albaniavisit.com/attractions/unesco-world-heritage-sites/), speaks of Greek, [Roman](https://albaniavisit.com/albanias-roman-era/), and [Byzantine](https://albaniavisit.com/byzantine-era-albania/) legacies. But the beach’s recent past gives it a unique character.

These peaceful waters became a theater of conflict during World War II. The Strait of Corfu, visible from the shore, was the site of the [1946 Corfu Channel Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corfu_Channel_incident).

British warships struck mines in these narrow waters, igniting an international dispute that reached the newly formed United Nations.

As you gaze across to Corfu, seemingly within reach, you’re looking at a stretch of sea that once captured global attention.

From Iron Curtain to Golden Sands

World War II’s end didn’t bring peace to Pema e Thatë. Under Enver Hoxha’s [communist regime](https://albaniavisit.com/communist-era/), this stunning coastline transformed into a militarized zone.

The beach where families now picnic was once patrolled by armed guards, their eyes fixed on the horizon, watching for those desperate enough to attempt swimming to the freedom Corfu represented.

The same views that now attract beachgoers once tormented those trapped behind the Iron Curtain.

Today, only occasional concrete bunkers remain stark reminders of this dark chapter amidst the surrounding natural beauty.

Nature’s Resilient Reclamation

Nature has reclaimed Pema e Thatë, enveloping the beach in Mediterranean flora and creating an ecosystem as rich as its history.

As part of [Butrint National Park](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/butrint/), the area is a haven for wildlife.

Lucky visitors might spot flamingos in nearby lagoons or dolphins playing in the strait.

The waters off Pema e Thatë offer more than scenic beauty.

Local lore celebrates the delicious mussels farmed in the nutrient-rich Butrint Lagoon.

These delicacies, served in beachside tavernas, provide a taste of the region’s natural bounty.

Legends Carried on Sea Breezes

As the sun sets, painting the sky in breathtaking hues, it’s easy to understand why this land is steeped in legend.

According to Virgil’s Aeneid, it was on these shores that Aeneas, fleeing Troy’s fall, founded the city of Butrint.

Whether you believe the myths or not, there’s undeniable magic in the air as daylight fades and Corfu’s lights twinkle to life across the water.

A Beach for the Curious Explorer

Today, Pema e Thatë welcomes visitors warmly, a stark contrast to its guarded past. The beach offers a perfect blend of relaxation and exploration.

Sunbathe on its pebble shores, swim in once-forbidden waters, or use it as a base to explore Butrint’s ruins.

For the more adventurous, [boat trips to Corfu](https://albaniavisit.com/travel-guide/ferry-services/) provide an opportunity to cross the once-contested strait and experience a slice of Greek island life.

The journey typically takes about 30-45 minutes, depending on the ferry line and your departure point.

Once in Corfu, you can explore its charming Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage site, visit picturesque beaches, or sample delicious Greek cuisine.

The Sands of Time

Pema e Thatë offers a solid beach experience near Ksamil. Its standout feature is the contrast between the pebbly shore and surprisingly sandy bottom. Clear views of Corfu add an international touch.

The beach’s history as a former restricted zone provides an intriguing backdrop.

On-site amenities include a pizzeria and beach bar. Depending on the season, umbrella and chair rentals are available for $10-40 daily.

The beach is generally less crowded than more popular beaches in the area.

Pema e Thatë offers good swimming, relaxation, and a hint of history. If you’re near, it’s worth visiting for a day by the sea.
