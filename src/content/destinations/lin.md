Why Visit Lin

Lake Ohrid’s western shore hides one of Europe’s best-kept secrets—Lin. A peaceful village perched on a peninsula, Lin is more than just a scenic stop: it’s the site of Europe’s oldest lakeside settlement, a haven for trout fishermen, and a living crossroads of Albanian and Macedonian culture.

In 2023, underwater archaeologists confirmed that Lin is the site of Europe’s oldest known stilt-house settlement — older than the Swiss pile dwellings by nearly 2,000 years. Beneath [Lake Ohrid](https://albaniavisit.com/attractions/lake-ohrid/), they found wooden posts, artifacts, seeds, and evidence of a Neolithic village that dates back over 8,500 years.

Above the water, Lin holds another treasure: the 6th-century Byzantine basilica that crowns the village hill. Covered for protection most of the year, its mosaics depict birds, bees, and fish, echoing both [Christian themes](https://albaniavisit.com/byzantine-era-albania/) and Lake Ohrid’s natural life. You can contact the caretaker to arrange a private viewing.

Best Time to Visit

Late May to mid-June, and September to October. You’ll beat the summer crowds, the water is warm, and everything’s open.

In winter, it’s quiet. Some guesthouses stay open, especially if you message in advance. The lake turns moody, and the pace slows even more.

![Lin Village market](/images/destinations/Lin-Village-Organic-food.jpg)Your Turn to Visit

You’re not coming to Lin for five-star hotels. You’re coming to watch fishermen row out at dawn. To eat food grown meters from your plate. To stand on stones older than the pyramids.

Lin isn’t trying to impress you. It just is. That’s exactly why it stays with you.
