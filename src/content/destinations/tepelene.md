Historical Significance

Ottoman-era ruler Ali Pasha Tepelena ascended politically after 1788 to become the de facto leader of Albania just as the [Ottoman empire’s influence](https://albaniavisit.com/albania-under-ottoman-rule/) waned after centuries entrenched across the Western Balkans. His epic rise and controversial rule naturally permeate many Tepelene landmarks today, like the memorial shrine and fortress ruins still being unearthed after attacks left the complex severely damaged at points over the years.

Visitors should allow an additional two days to discover the Sete Gorge bridge, ancient monasteries, and natural phenomena like the ‘Eye of Tepelena’ blue whirlpool lake, rewarding those who reach its remote mountain location with uncommon views.

Your Turn to Visit

From its defensive mountain engineering to recent infrastructure expanding regional tourism, Tepelene’s past and future progress in parallel where visitors still encounter history in the making along idyllic Vjosë banks fed for millennia.
