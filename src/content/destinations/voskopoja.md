## Why Visit Voskopoja

Albania’s Hidden Mountain Retreat

Located high in the mountains of southeastern Albania, Voskopoja offers a rare blend of history, culture, and natural beauty. This village isn’t a typical tourist stop, and that’s what makes it special. Once a bustling center of trade and learning, it’s now a quiet place where old churches and stone paths reveal a fascinating past.

The air is crisp, the welcome is warm, and the sense of stepping into a different era is strong. Expect worn frescoes and uneven trails rather than polished perfection—it’s this raw authenticity that draws people in. Whether you’re here for the ancient architecture or the peaceful surroundings, Voskopoja leaves a lasting impression.

Top Attractions and Landmarks

Voskopoja’s history has shaped a collection of landmarks that stand out for their age and character. Here’s what to explore:

The Byzantine Churches

These structures are more than just buildings—they’re pieces of the past brought to life. In 2002, five of them were recognized on the World Monuments Fund’s Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites, a nod to their importance and fragility.

-   **The Monastery of St. John the Baptist**: A calm spot with arched porches and a distinct Byzantine style that invites you to pause.
-   **The Church of St. Mary**: Inside, colorful frescoes cover the walls, telling stories in a space that feels both holy and human.
-   **The Church of St. Athanasius**: Plain yet powerful, it’s a survivor of the village’s ups and downs.
-   **The Church of St. Nicholas**: Known for David Selenica’s vivid murals, which shine despite their age and wear.

These churches share a common design: three-aisled basilicas with gable roofs and single apses. They show signs of time—cracks and faded paint—but that only adds to their appeal.

Beyond the Churches

The village’s cobbled streets wind past traditional homes perched on the hillsides. Beyond the buildings, thick forests and tall peaks surround Voskopoja, offering rugged trails for hikers. In winter, the area transforms into a ski destination, attracting those who enjoy a less crowded slope. It’s not a flashy place, but its realness stands out.

Voskopoja’s Storied Past

Voskopoja’s story stretches back centuries, likely beginning around the 14th century during the Byzantine period. By the 18th century, it had grown into one of the Balkans’ largest cities, rivaled only by Istanbul. Positioned on the Tsarigrad Road, a major trade route, it became a busy hub called the “City of Shepherds.”

Crafts like metal smithing, wool production, and leather tanning fueled its economy. Its Aromanian population—Latin-speaking people—blended with Greek influences in religion and commerce, sparking a cultural peak. This era saw the Balkans’ first printing press outside Istanbul, the New Academy, and as many as 30 churches. It was a center of art, thought, and faith.

That prosperity didn’t last. In the late 18th century, raids by Ali Pasha devastated the village, reducing it to a fraction of its former size. Today, it’s a small community again, but its Aromanian roots and weathered churches keep its history alive.

Cuisine and Village Life

Food in Voskopoja is straightforward and satisfying, rooted in Albanian traditions with hints of Balkan and Mediterranean flavors. Expect grilled meats, thick stews, and perhaps a touch of Italian-inspired dishes—nothing fancy, just hearty and well-made. Local eateries are casual; grab a coffee (a daily ritual done right here) and enjoy the moment. It’s less about the plate and more about the experience.
