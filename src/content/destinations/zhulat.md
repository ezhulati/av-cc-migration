A Timeless Albanian Village with a Legacy of Law and Legend

As I stand at the edge of Zhulat village, gazing across the rolling hills of the Gjirokastër region, I feel a connection that transcends the centuries. My family name—Zhulati—carries the echo of this very place, a testament to my ancestors who once called these stone houses home.

When the [Ottomans](https://albaniavisit.com/albania-under-ottoman-rule/) swept through southern Albania, my forefathers made the difficult choice to preserve their Christian faith by relocating to the highlands of the village of [Grabovë](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/grabove/) near [Përmet](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/permet/), taking with them not possessions, but something far more precious: the name of their beloved village as their family identity.

This practice was common in those tumultuous times—a way for displaced Albanians to maintain their connection to ancestral lands. Today, as I introduce you to Zhulat, I invite you to discover not just a destination, but a living testament to Albania’s enduring spirit and rich cultural tapestry.

Where Past Meets Present

Nestled in the picturesque landscapes of southern Albania, Zhulat is a hidden treasure within the Gjirokastër municipality. Following the 2015 local government reform, this once-independent village (previously part of Cepo municipality) became administratively linked to [Gjirokastër](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/gjirokaster/), though it maintains its distinct identity and traditions.

The journey to Zhulat takes you along winding roads between [Tepelenë](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/tepelene/) and Gjirokastër, through some of Albania’s most breathtaking countryside. As you approach, the village reveals itself gradually—traditional stone houses with slate roofs clustered together against the verdant backdrop of surrounding hills, a scene that has remained largely unchanged for centuries.

The Origins of a Name

The name “Zhulat” itself carries fascinating historical significance. Linguists believe it derives from a collective plural structure similar to other Albanian place names, suggesting it originally meant “the descendants of Zhuli.” This points to the village being founded or led by an ancestor figure of that name.

Historical records support this theory, with old chronicles referring to the village with varying names such as “Julius” and “Zhul,” indicating a probable evolution from a Latin name (Julius) that transformed through generations of local speech. The connection between place and people grew so strong that when families like mine left, they carried the village name with them as their surname—creating living lineages of Zhulat’s diaspora across Albania and beyond.

Papa Zhuli and the Kanun of Labëria

Perhaps the most significant figure in Zhulat’s history is Papa Zhuli, a medieval elder and cleric who became the architect of the region’s customary law. According to oral tradition preserved through generations, Papa Zhuli served as the chief priest of Kurvelesh during the Norman invasion of 1081. His wisdom and leadership during this crisis earned him legendary status, and he is credited with creating the law of Labëria—the “Kanun of Papa Zhuli.”

This unwritten code regulated social conduct throughout southern Albania for centuries, becoming a cornerstone of cultural identity in the region. Byzantine records even mention a certain [Petro Zhulati](https://sq.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petro_Zhulati) as a provincial lord (archon) in the late 11th century, adding historical weight to the village’s significance during this period.

The legacy of [Papa Zhuli](https://sq.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papa_Zhuli) continued through the ages. In the 18th century, another elder from Zhulat named Idriz Sulli undertook a reform of the [Kanun of Labëria](https://sq.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanuni), adapting it to changing social conditions. So profound was his influence that the code became known as the “Kanun of Idriz Sulli” in recognition of his contributions, though its roots remained firmly planted in the wisdom of Papa Zhuli.

Ancient Fortress and Strategic Significance

Rising above the village, the ruins of Zhulat Castle stand as a testament to the area’s strategic importance throughout history. Archaeological evidence suggests this fortress may date back to the early 3rd century BCE, indicating that the location was a valued stronghold even in ancient Illyrian times.

The prominent Ottoman traveler [Evliya Çelebi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evliya_%C3%87elebi) visited Zhulat in 1670 and described it as a “mountainous stronghold” with about 200 houses beneath a naturally well-defended clifftop. He noted the surrounding hills covered in vineyards and mentioned how villagers traded handicraft products with distant towns, painting a picture of a thriving, self-sufficient community.

According to local folklore recounted by Çelebi, the castle was originally founded by a “King of Spain” when the villagers were his allies, later taken over by Venetian control, and finally seized by Ottoman forces. While partly legendary, these tales reflect the real historical transitions that shaped Zhulat’s destiny.

A Village of Patriots

Throughout modern Albanian history, [Zhulat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhulat) earned a reputation for patriotism and resistance against foreign domination. During the national awakening and the waning Ottoman period, the village contributed significantly to Albania’s independence struggles.

In April 1914, villagers like Hazhi Zeman Muxhai participated in the important assembly at Shtëpëzi, pledging to [expel Greek irregulars](https://sq.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beteja_e_Qaf%C3%ABs_s%C3%AB_Sk%C3%ABrfic%C3%ABs) and uphold the authority of the fledgling Albanian state. This tradition of sacrifice continued into the 20th century; local heroes from Zhulat fought in the Vlora War of 1920 against Italian forces and later joined antifascist partisan units during World War II.

Cultural Heritage and Living Traditions

Despite its small size, Zhulat has produced many notable cultural figures. One of the most celebrated is [Idriz Sulli](https://sq.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idriz_Suli), a renowned Albanian folk poet and songwriter born here in 1895, whose life and work remain an important part of regional cultural heritage.

The village is also known for its contributions to Labërian folk traditions, particularly the distinctive polyphonic singing that has been recognized by UNESCO as intangible cultural heritage. Zhulat’s own ensemble often performs iso-polyphonic songs that recount historical narratives, blending melody with memory to preserve the past.

The traditional Labërian folk costumes associated with Zhulat—including the black xhubleta skirt for women and the white fustanella kilt for men—are characteristic of the broader Gjirokastër Highlands and represent an important element of Albania’s ethnographic treasure.
