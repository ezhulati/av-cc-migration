A Brief History of Lezhë

Lezhë has a rich history, shaped by various civilizations due to its strategic location on the Adriatic coast and at the crossroads of important trade routes.

Whether you’re a history enthusiast, nature lover, or foodie, Lezhë offers something for everyone.

Ancient Origins and Illyrian Roots

In the Neolithic period, Lezhë was known as Lissus during the Illyrian times.

The name is believed to mean “place with water” in the Illyrian language.

The [Illyrians](https://albaniavisit.com/the-illyrians/) were skilled warriors and traders who established a powerful kingdom extending from modern-day Albania to Croatia.

Renowned for their metalworking skills, they left a lasting legacy in the region.

After the Roman conquest in the 2nd century BC, Lezhë became a Roman colony, and structures like a theater and a forum were built.

A significant event in the town’s history was the League of Lezhë in 1444 when Albanian princes united under Skanderbeg’s leadership to resist the [Ottoman invasion](https://albaniavisit.com/albania-under-ottoman-rule/).

This marked the beginning of a prolonged struggle for independence.

The Role of Lezhë in the Middle Ages

In the Middle Ages, Lezhë was a border town between the [Byzantine Empire](https://albaniavisit.com/byzantine-era-albania/) and the Kingdom of Serbia.

During the 14th century, it was ruled by the Balsha family, a prominent Albanian dynasty that resisted Ottoman and Venetian forces.

The town became a center of learning and culture, with notable scholars and artists.

The Balsha family contributed to its architectural heritage by building structures like a castle and a church, which still stand today.

Conquered by the Ottomans in 1478, Lezhë remained under their rule until Albania’s independence in 1912.

During this period, the town flourished as a center of trade and craftsmanship, with additions like a mosque and a public bath enhancing its architectural landscape.
