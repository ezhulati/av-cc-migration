Albania’s Captivating Ancient Ruins

Amidst Albania’s dramatic landscapes lie significant historical sites that offer travelers deep insights into the evolution of European cultures. 

These remnants tell tales of [Illyrian tribes](https://albaniavisit.com/the-illyrians/), Greek colonies, [Roman conquests](https://albaniavisit.com/albanias-roman-era/), and [Ottoman expansion](https://albaniavisit.com/albania-under-ottoman-rule/).

While Albania is home to four UNESCO World Heritage sites—including Butrint and Berat—many lesser-known locations await exploration.

By visiting these well-preserved ruins, history enthusiasts can understand how strategic Mediterranean positions and rugged terrains shaped the destinies of empires.

Greek Coastal Settlements

Starting around the 7th century BCE, Greek settlers impacted Albania’s southern coastal plains. Key port cities like Apollonia and Byllis became important centers of Mediterranean trade and regional events.

Archaeological findings reveal advanced infrastructures, including aqueducts, piping systems, and large marketplaces lined with columns.

Founded in 588 BCE, Apollonia grew into a prominent Greek city-state before experiencing the Roman, [Byzantine](https://albaniavisit.com/byzantine-era-albania/), and Norman periods.

Visitors can explore ruins such as the Bouleuterion council house, a theater seating 3,500 people, and one of the area’s largest early churches, highlighting the extended Greek presence.

The Roman Era Along the Coast

After taking control in 168 BCE, the Romans built upon earlier Greek and Illyrian foundations, significantly improving infrastructure and living standards along Albania’s southern coast.

As the Roman Republic’s power and ambitions grew, so did its regional influence.

Situated on a defensible ridge overlooking the Bay of Vlorë, the ancient city of Oricum offers insights into its strategic role in protecting the Straits of Otranto—the route toward Rome—from 146 BCE onward.

Visitors can admire the city’s layout, theater, and grand villas. Remarkably, multi-level water channels still deliver fresh water through ancient tunnels.

In Durrës, the largest arena in the Balkans, constructed in the 2nd century AD during Emperor Trajan’s reign, is a testament to Roman architectural prowess.

Despite the damage caused by the earthquake, its remains reflect its past grandeur. It once hosted events for up to 20,000 spectators.

4\. The Ancient City of Apollonia

As mentioned earlier, [Apollonia](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/apollonia/) is significant for its Greek beginnings and as a UNESCO site representing a fusion of cultural influences over centuries.

Apollonia was an ancient Greek city in Illyria, located on the right bank of the Vjosa River.

Its ruins are situated in the Fier region, near the village of Pojani, in modern-day Albania.

Apollonia was founded in 588 BCE by Greek colonists from Corfu and Corinth on a site initially occupied by Illyrian tribes.

It was perhaps the most important of the several classical towns known as Apollonia.

The archaeological park allows visitors to step back in time among temples, stoas, and other classical structures.

Krujë: The Fortress of National Hero Skanderbeg

The historic town of [Krujë](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/kruje/) is home to the Kala Fortress, associated with Albania’s national hero, Skanderbeg.

In the 15th century, Skanderbeg led resistance against Ottoman forces, notably repelling Sultan Mehmet II’s armies.
