Albania by Bike

Mountain biking in Albania offers a thrilling and diverse experience for adventure seekers. The country’s landscapes, ranging from stunning coastlines to snow-covered mountains, make it an ideal destination for cyclists of all levels.

Getting There-   **By Plane**: Albania is easily accessible by plane from Europe. Airlines like Wizzair have direct connections to Tirana from various European cities. Bringing a bicycle on a plane typically costs around 40 euros with Wizzair​[](https://wobblyride.com/2022/05/18/cycling-albania-practical-bike-touring-guide/#:~:text=)​.
-   **By Ferry**: Ferries from Italy to Albania are available, with prices that include bike transport of around 60 euros​[](https://wobblyride.com/2022/05/18/cycling-albania-practical-bike-touring-guide/)​.Bike Rental and Shops-   **Rental**: If you don’t have your bike, you can rent one in major towns and cities in Albania.

With over 70% mountains, Albania delivers endless off-road possibilities. The northern Albanian Alps and Accursed Mountains serve up rugged peaks and dizzying ridge rides with knife-edge drops. Test your technical handling picking through the overgrown singletracks of dense central forests past abandoned monasteries. In the south, canyon trails will leave your arms aching before you reach sun-drenched coastal olive groves.

Popular destinations for mountain biking include Valbona Valley National Park, the Albanian Alps, and the Tomorr Mountain Range​[](https://www.bikesmap.com/europe/albania#:~:text=,road%20bikes%2C%20and%20kids%27%20bikes)​.Some beautiful mountain biking trails can be explored in areas like Berat and along the Osumi valley​​.

Safety and Traffic

Albania’s roads can be contradictory in terms of safety. Main roads might feel unsafe due to close overtaking by drivers. However, most roads in the country are quiet and perfect for cycling​[](https://wobblyride.com/2022/05/18/cycling-albania-practical-bike-touring-guide/#:~:text=%23%23%20Terrain%0A%0AMore%20than%2070%20,and%20exciting%20than%20the%20mountains)​.

Weather and Best Time to Visit

Albania’s Mediterranean climate makes it an ideal destination for cycling holidays. The best time to visit is from April to June and September to October. July and August can be extremely hot, making cycling challenging​[](https://wobblyride.com/2022/05/18/cycling-albania-practical-bike-touring-guide/)​.

It’s advisable to carry cash, especially in rural areas​[](https://wobblyride.com/2022/05/18/cycling-albania-practical-bike-touring-guide/#:~:text=I%20have%20met%20a%20Dutch,800%20lek)​.

The best views might come from local riding clubs. Join their weekly rides or buy them an espresso to share hidden high-country routes where only foxes and eagles tread. Their hand-drawn maps full of faded tracks might not make sense at first. But you’ll soon bond over post-ride raki toasts as you recount getting lost and found again on Albania’s singletracks.
