The villa itself is a testament to thoughtful design, featuring a terrace that presents breathtaking mountain views, creating a perfect backdrop for any stay. Inside, guests are treated to a cozy yet spacious layout that includes two bedrooms, a living room equipped with a satellite flat-screen TV for entertainment, an equipped kitchen for those who love to cook, and a bathroom that doesn't skimp on luxuries, offering a walk-in shower and a bidet. An additional bathroom ensures convenience, complete with slippers for that extra touch of home. The presence of a fireplace adds a layer of warmth and charm to the entire space, making it an inviting haven during cooler evenings.

For those who find solace in nature, the villa's garden offers a tranquil spot to unwind and soak in the serene surroundings.

Beyond the confines of Vila Emante, the Bay of Bones awaits at 18 km away, offering a glimpse into the region's rich history, while the Early Christian Basilica, 34 km away, beckons with its architectural splendor. For guests arriving by air, Ohrid Airport is conveniently located 41 km from the villa, making travel arrangements seamless.

Vila Emante stands out as a premier choice for travelers seeking a blend of tranquility, comfort, and convenience in the heart of Tushemisht.
