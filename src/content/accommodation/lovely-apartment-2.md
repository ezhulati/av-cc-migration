The apartment itself is a haven of comfort, featuring a cozy bedroom complemented by a living room equipped with a flat-screen TV and streaming services for those evenings in. The kitchen doesn't disappoint either, being fully equipped with a fridge and stovetop, ensuring that guests have everything they need to whip up a delightful meal. The inclusion of slippers, towels, and bed linen adds a touch of home-away-from-home comfort, while the private entrance ensures utmost privacy.

For those keen on exploring the local area, Lovely Apartment 2 serves as the perfect base. From fishing adventures in the nearby waters to exploring the Rock of Kavaje, located just 5.7 km away, there's no shortage of activities to fill your days. The historical Former Residence of Enver Hoxha is also within a manageable distance for those interested in delving into the country's past.

Situated 47 km from the bustling Skanderbeg Square and with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport only 41 km away, guests have the added convenience of a paid airport shuttle service, making travel arrangements seamless.

Lovely Apartment 2 is more than just a place to stay; it's a gateway to experiencing the beauty and adventure that Golem has to offer.
