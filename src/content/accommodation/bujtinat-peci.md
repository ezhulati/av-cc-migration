The apartment itself is a study in thoughtful accommodation, featuring a single bedroom that promises restful nights. The presence of a fully equipped kitchen allows guests the freedom to craft their meals, adding a touch of home. The convenience is complemented by a modern bathroom and the entertainment needs are well catered to with a flat-screen TV, all within a smoke-free environment.

For moments of leisure, the garden invites guests to unwind in its peaceful embrace.

Situated a manageable distance from the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, which is 74 km away, Bujtinat Peci stands as an ideal choice for travelers seeking a blend of relaxation and accessibility in Elbasan.
