Guests at Belix City Apartments are treated to a suite of amenities designed to enhance their stay. Each apartment boasts a balcony offering breathtaking sea views, alongside a well-appointed living room, a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a fully equipped kitchen featuring an oven and a fridge. The convenience extends to the bathroom, equipped with a bidet, and the option to request towels and linens for an additional comfort.

The commitment to guest comfort is evident in the non-smoking, soundproof rooms, ensuring a peaceful retreat from the bustling city life. Moreover, the inclusion of a lift, private check-in and check-out services, and currency exchange facilities underscores the establishment's dedication to providing a seamless and hassle-free experience.

For those needing to pick up essentials or snacks, a minimarket on the premises caters to those needs without having to leave the comfort of the apartment complex.

Explorers eager to venture beyond the beach will find the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, located 44 km away, offering scenic views of the area, while the Rock of Kavaje, a mere 12 km from the apartments, presents an opportunity for memorable excursions. Conveniently, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is just 34 km away, making Belix City Apartments an ideal base for both short and extended stays in Durrës.
