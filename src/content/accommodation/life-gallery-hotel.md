Occupying a prime spot on the revamped Republika Boulevard, the Life Gallery Hotel complex is a unique blend of history and modernity, comprising four buildings and a charming summer terrace. The centerpiece is a beautifully preserved aristocratic house from 1924, featuring a meeting room on the ground floor, a welcoming hall on the first, and a restaurant offering panoramic views on the top floor.

Adding to the hotel's appeal are two additional buildings, constructed to provide guests with 28 additional rooms, a relaxing SPA, and a state-of-the-art gym. The third building, an Italian-style villa, harks back to the elegance of the 1936 concept bar era, offering guests a unique architectural experience.

Adjacent to the hall, the Tenda BAR awaits, offering an extensive selection of cocktails and beverages, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration.

Situated just 800 meters from the center of Korçë, the Life Gallery Hotel serves as an ideal base for guests eager to explore the city's cultural landmarks. The National Museum of Medieval Art, the Orthodox Resurrection Cathedral - the second largest church in the Balkans, and the Iljaz Mirahori Mosque, the oldest in the region, are all within easy reach, making this hotel not just a place to stay, but a gateway to the rich history and culture of Korçë.
