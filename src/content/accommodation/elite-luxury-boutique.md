Newly opened luxury hotel, ample and safe parking right in front of the hotel entrance.
The room was spacious, beautifully decorated with a modern touch but not impersonal. The bathroom was just the right size with a large shower and all the necessary amenities.
The restaurant is lovely and we had an awesome dinner.
We were warmly welcomed by all the staff who went the extra mile to make our stay exceptional. We felt right at home.
Very highly recommended.‚Äù"\n  - name: "Ortensia"\n    country: "Italy"\n    text: "‚ÄúElite Luxury Boutique is a brand new hotel that deserves that name. But the people made it so warm and I host that you feel like you're home. They were always willing to satisfy our every wish.
