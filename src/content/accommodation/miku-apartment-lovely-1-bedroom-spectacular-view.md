The apartment itself is a haven of space and light, offering guests a serene balcony from which to enjoy breathtaking mountain vistas. The interior is thoughtfully designed to provide all the comforts of home, including a fully equipped kitchen with modern appliances, a cozy living room for relaxation, a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a pristine bathroom complete with a bidet. Attention to detail is evident in the provision of quality towels and bed linen, ensuring a comfortable and restful stay.

For those who prefer the convenience of self-catering, a minimarket on the premises caters to all essential shopping needs. Additionally, the availability of a car rental service directly from the apartment offers guests the freedom to explore Tirana and its surroundings at their own pace.

Situated just 2 km from the lush expanses of the Grand Park of Tirana and 2.2 km from the iconic Pyramid of Tirana, Miku Apartment is not only a gateway to the city's natural and architectural wonders but also a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle. With Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport only 14 km away, guests enjoy easy access to and from this charming accommodation, making it an ideal choice for both short visits and extended stays in Albania's captivating capital.
