The fully equipped kitchen invites guests to prepare their own meals, adding a touch of home to their travel experience. Entertainment is readily available with the inclusion of a flat-screen TV, ensuring relaxation after a day of exploration.

Strategically located, the apartment is a short walk from Skanderbeg Square, placing guests in the pulsating heart of Tirana. Attractions such as the Pyramid of Tirana, Reja - The Cloud, and Rinia Park are also within easy reach, making it an ideal base for those eager to uncover the city's treasures. Despite its central location, the property maintains a tranquil atmosphere, being a non-smoking environment and set away from the hustle and bustle.

For those looking to venture further, the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car offers breathtaking views from 6 km away, while the Rock of Kavaje, 45 km from the apartment, presents an opportunity for a scenic day trip. Convenience is key, with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport located just 16 km away, ensuring smooth arrivals and departures.

The Classic Flat stands out as a perfect blend of comfort, convenience, and culture, making it an exceptional choice for travelers seeking to immerse themselves in the essence of Tirana.
