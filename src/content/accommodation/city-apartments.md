Guests will find themselves enveloped in the comfort of a spacious two-bedroom apartment, complete with modern amenities. The living space is equipped with a flat-screen TV, a fully equipped kitchen for those who prefer to prepare their own meals, a washing machine for added convenience, and a bathroom featuring a refreshing shower. The addition of air conditioning ensures a comfortable stay regardless of the season.

Meanwhile, the House of Leaves museum is just 2.3 km from the apartment, offering a deep dive into the country's history.
