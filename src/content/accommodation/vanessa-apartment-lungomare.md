Guests can enjoy the comfort of two well-appointed bedrooms, a cozy living room, and the convenience of a fully equipped kitchen. The inclusion of two modern bathrooms with showers adds to the ease of living here. The highlight, however, is the balcony that opens up to mesmerizing sea vistas, promising a tranquil backdrop for morning coffees or evening reflections.

Beyond the confines of the apartment, visitors will find themselves close to notable landmarks such as Independence Square and Kuzum Baba, both less than 3 km away, making cultural excursions an effortless endeavor. For those arriving from afar, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is 151 km from the doorstep of Vanessa Apartment Lungomare, ensuring connectivity to and from this idyllic escape.

With its combination of comfort, convenience, and location, Vanessa Apartment Lungomare stands as a compelling choice for those looking to experience the best of Vlorë's coastal charm.
