Guests are treated to a spacious layout that includes two bedrooms, a living room that opens up to breathtaking sea views from a private balcony, and a fully equipped kitchen with modern amenities such as a toaster and a fridge. The inclusion of a flat-screen TV ensures entertainment is always at hand, while the convenience of an in-apartment bathroom equipped with a bidet adds to the comfort. For those who appreciate the finer details, towels and bed linen are thoughtfully provided, enhancing the home-away-from-home experience.

The apartment doesn't just stop at providing a comfortable stay; it also offers an outdoor dining area, perfect for those moments when dining under the stars is too tempting to resist. While the tranquility of Lungomare Rei's Apartment might make leaving seem unnecessary, the proximity to Skanderbeg Square and the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, located 40 km and 43 km away respectively, encourages exploration. Furthermore, with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport only 34 km away, and the availability of a paid airport shuttle service, guests will find both arrival and departure to be seamless experiences.

Lungomare Rei's Apartment is more than just a place to stay; it's a gateway to the delights of DurrÃ«s, offering both the tranquility of the sea and the adventure of the city.
