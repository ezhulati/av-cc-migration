The apartment is fully equipped for a hassle-free stay, featuring a modern kitchen with an oven and stovetop, a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a bathroom complete with a bidet, ensuring all the comforts of home are at guests' fingertips. Despite its central location, Joni's Home guarantees a peaceful retreat with its quiet street views, allowing for a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle.

Situated a short drive from the historic Durres Beach, 2.4 km away, and within reach of the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, 47 km away, guests have the perfect opportunity to explore the rich cultural tapestry and natural beauty of the area. The Rock of Kavaje, another notable attraction, is just 1.4 km from the doorstep, making Joni's Home an ideal base for adventurers and beach lovers alike.

For those traveling to or from the area, the convenience of Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 37 km away, adds to the appeal of Joni's Home, making it a top choice for both short getaways and extended stays in Durrës.
