The space itself is a haven of modern living, featuring air conditioning for those warm Albanian afternoons. It houses two cozy bedrooms, a welcoming living room, and a kitchen equipped with everything needed for a home-cooked meal, including a dishwasher and kettle. The bathroom doesn’t skimp on comfort either, providing a bidet and soft bathrobes alongside towels and bed linen for a touch of home.

For guests interested in the cultural heartbeat of Tirana, Mina is ideally located. A stone's throw away are the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet of Albania, the intriguing House of Leaves, and the iconic Clock Tower Tirana, each offering a unique glimpse into the city's rich history and vibrant cultural scene.

Connectivity is never an issue, with complimentary WiFi for all guests and private parking available for those with vehicles, albeit at an additional charge. It's worth noting that Mina is a non-smoking accommodation, ensuring a clean and fresh environment for the duration of your stay.

For those flying in, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is conveniently located just 13 km away, making Mina an accessible and attractive option for international and domestic travelers alike.
