The apartment itself is a testament to modern living, boasting a spacious terrace that offers breathtaking sea views, perfect for those who appreciate the beauty of the Adriatic Sea. Inside, guests will find two cozy bedrooms, a living room equipped with a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a fully equipped kitchen that includes an oven and a fridge, catering to all culinary needs. The inclusion of a bathroom with a bidet adds a touch of convenience, while the patio serves as a charming outdoor dining area, enhancing the overall stay experience.

Notably, the apartment takes pride in offering thoughtful touches such as chocolates or cookies, adding a personal feel to the welcoming atmosphere. For those traveling from afar, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is located 150 km away, making Pearl Apartament an accessible retreat for both local and international visitors looking for a peaceful yet convenient getaway in Vlorë.
