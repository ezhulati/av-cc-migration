Guests will find themselves enveloped in the comfort of a well-appointed 1-bedroom apartment, complete with a cozy living room adorned with a flat-screen TV for those relaxing nights in. The kitchen doesn't skimp on necessities either, featuring a fridge and stovetop for home-cooked meals, alongside a bathroom equipped with a refreshing shower. The provision of towels and bed linen adds a touch of home, ensuring a comfortable stay. Notably, the apartment prides itself on offering a private entrance, enhancing the sense of privacy and exclusivity for its guests.

For those venturing from afar, the proximity to Ioannina Airport, located 143 km away, underscores the apartment's appeal to both local and international travelers. Central Apartment 1 stands as a testament to the blend of accessibility, comfort, and privacy, making it a compelling choice for those exploring the enchanting landscapes of Himare.
