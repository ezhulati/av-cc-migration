Security is paramount, with round-the-clock services ensuring a worry-free stay. The establishment prides itself on offering a suite of amenities including a 24-hour front desk, elevator access for ease of movement, and currency exchange services to cater to international guests.

Accommodation at the Lovely apartment is thoughtfully designed with a cozy bedroom, a fully equipped kitchen featuring an oven and microwave for home-cooked meals, and a living area with a flat-screen TV for entertainment. The bathroom comes well-appointed with a bidet, complemented by the provision of bed linen, towels, and a convenient laundry service.

For those looking to explore Tirana at their own pace, the apartment facilitates both bicycle and car rental services, adding an extra layer of convenience to your stay. A handy minimarket on the premises ensures that essentials are always within reach.

Situated near must-visit attractions such as the National Museum of History Albania, House of Leaves, and the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet of Albania, guests are perfectly placed to immerse themselves in the local culture. For ease of travel, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is a mere 13 km away, making the Lovely apartment an ideal base for both short and extended visits to this dynamic city.
