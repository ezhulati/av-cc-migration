Dining at Vila Ahmeti becomes an event in itself, with the restaurant serving up traditional dishes that are sure to satisfy any palate. The added convenience of room service elevates the dining experience, allowing guests to enjoy meals in the comfort of their own rooms. For those arriving by car, the availability of free private parking is a welcome feature, removing any worries about vehicle security.

Strategically located, Vila Ahmeti is a mere 10-minute stroll from the Main Bus Station and just a 12-minute walk from the bustling Sarandë Ferry Port, making it an ideal base for exploring the area. For international travelers, Tirana Airport is 280 km away, but the journey is well worth the distance to experience the tranquility and hospitality Vila Ahmeti offers.
