This apartment doesn't just offer a place to stay; it provides a home away from home. Guests are treated to a generously sized living space that boasts a balcony for those serene morning coffees or tranquil evening reflections. The layout includes two cozy bedrooms, a living area designed for relaxation, and a kitchen that comes fully equipped with modern appliances, including a dishwasher, ensuring that every need is met with ease.

Entertainment and connectivity are well catered for, with complimentary WiFi enveloping the property and a flat-screen TV available for guests' enjoyment. The added benefit of a private entrance enhances the sense of exclusivity and privacy, making it an ideal retreat for those who value their solitude.

For those looking to explore beyond the city's confines, the Rock of Kavaje presents an intriguing destination, located 43 km away, while the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet of Albania offers cultural enrichment just 2 km from the doorstep. Furthermore, the convenience of being 13 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport adds to the appeal, ensuring smooth transitions from travel to relaxation.

Neri's Apartment stands as a testament to thoughtful accommodation that prioritizes guest comfort and convenience, making it a highly recommended stay for anyone visiting Tirana.
