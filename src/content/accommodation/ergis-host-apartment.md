Guest accommodations boast modern comforts such as air conditioning, refrigeration, and a minibar, alongside thoughtful touches like a coffee machine for that perfect morning start. Bathrooms, shared yet intimate, are well-appointed with a bidet, bathrobes, and even slippers to enhance the home-away-from-home experience. The commitment to guest satisfaction is evident in the complimentary WiFi and the special addition of fruits, chocolates, or cookies in the rooms, with select spaces also featuring a balcony for private outdoor relaxation.

Situated 48 km from the Rock of Kavaje and only 30 km from the House of Leaves, Ergi's Host Apartment offers a strategic location for explorers keen on delving into the area's rich history and natural beauty. Moreover, the convenience of being just 17 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport makes this guest house an ideal choice for both domestic and international travelers seeking a blend of comfort, convenience, and thoughtful hospitality in Krujë.
