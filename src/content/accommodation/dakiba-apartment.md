The dining space, alongside a fully equipped kitchen, allows guests the freedom to prepare meals with ease, adding a touch of home. Perhaps the most captivating aspect is the balcony, offering breathtaking sea views that promise to enchant every morning.

Beyond the confines of the apartment, guests can explore the local area, with the historical Kuzum Baba and Independence Square located just a short drive away, offering a glimpse into the rich cultural tapestry of Vlorë. For those traveling from afar, the convenience of Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, situated 154 km from Dakiba Apartment, ensures a seamless travel experience.
