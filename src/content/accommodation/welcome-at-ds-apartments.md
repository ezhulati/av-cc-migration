The highlight of DS' Apartments is undoubtedly its 2-bedroom offering, which comes complete with a cozy living room equipped with a flat-screen TV, a fully equipped kitchen featuring a microwave and minibar, and two well-appointed bathrooms with hair dryers. The added luxury of a private entrance enhances the sense of privacy and exclusivity.

For those looking to unwind with a drink, the convenience of an on-site bar cannot be overstated. The apartment's location is also ideal for exploring further afield, with the Rock of Kavaje and the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet of Albania easily accessible. Moreover, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, just 16 km away, makes DS' Apartments a compelling choice for both short and extended stays in Tirana.
