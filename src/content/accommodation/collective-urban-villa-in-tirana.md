The accommodations at Collective Urban Villa are designed with the modern traveler in mind, offering air-conditioned spaces that overlook a serene street scene, complemented by the convenience of complimentary WiFi. The garden views available in certain areas of the property provide a tranquil backdrop for guests' stay.

Attention to detail is evident in each apartment, which is equipped with a fully functional kitchen, including an oven, and a cozy seating area. Entertainment and practical needs are met with a flat-screen TV and a washing machine in each unit. The inclusion of a private bathroom with a bidet and hair dryer, along with the provision of bed linen and towels, underscores the villa's commitment to guest comfort.

For those needing essentials or a quick snack, the on-site minimarket is a welcome feature. The villa's location also means that guests are never far from exploring Tirana's cultural heart. Rinia Park, the Clock Tower of Tirana, and the Et'hem Bey Mosque are within easy reach, promising a blend of leisure and exploration.

Accessibility is further enhanced by the villa's proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located just 14 km away, making Collective Urban Villa an ideal base for both short visits and extended stays in Tirana.
