The apartment itself is a study in spaciousness and comfort, featuring a bedroom, a living area equipped with a cable flat-screen TV for entertainment, an equipped kitchen for those who prefer to prepare their meals, and a bathroom that offers both a bath and a shower. Unique to this accommodation is a private entrance, adding an extra layer of privacy, and a welcoming touch of complimentary fruits for guests to enjoy upon arrival. Emphasizing a healthy living environment, the entire apartment is non-smoking.

For those looking to unwind with a drink, the convenience of an on-site bar caters to this desire without the need to venture far. While the property promises a secluded retreat, it remains connected to the outside world, with Ioannina Airport located 159 km away, making it accessible for international and domestic travelers alike.

White Rocks emerges as a distinguished destination for those in pursuit of relaxation, privacy, and the natural beauty of Dhërmi's coastal landscape.
