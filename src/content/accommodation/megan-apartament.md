The apartment itself is a testament to spacious living, featuring two distinct bedrooms, a bathroom equipped with modern amenities, and a living room designed for relaxation with a flat-screen TV at its heart. The kitchen doesn't shy away from impressing either, boasting full equipment including an oven, set beside a dining area ready to host memorable meals. Adding to the charm is a balcony that serves as an enchanting outdoor dining space, inviting guests to dine under the sky.

For those traveling to or from the city, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is located 150 km away, making Megan Apartment not just a place to stay, but a convenient stopover in the journey through Albania.
