The living area is complemented by a flat-screen TV and a dining space, leading to a fully equipped kitchen for those who enjoy crafting their meals. Perhaps the highlight for many is the balcony, presenting breathtaking sea views that promise to elevate any stay. While towels and linens are available upon request, the outdoor dining area invites guests to enjoy their meals against the backdrop of Sarandë's scenic coastline.

For those keen on exploring the area, Appartement facilitates adventure with both bicycle and car rental services, making it effortless to venture beyond the immediate surroundings. La Petite Beach awaits at a modest distance, offering a quieter slice of the coast, while the historic allure of Butrint National Park is just a drive away. For international travelers, Ioannina Airport serves as the nearest gateway, located 96 km from the property.

In essence, Appartement stands out as a stellar accommodation choice, promising a blend of home comforts and easy access to some of Sarandë's most sought-after attractions.
