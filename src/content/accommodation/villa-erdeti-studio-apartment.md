Each air-conditioned apartment at Villa Erdeti boasts a furnished balcony, providing a serene spot for guests to unwind while enjoying the fresh air. The inclusion of cable TV adds a touch of home comfort, making it easy for visitors to relax after a day of exploration.

Situated merely 4.5 km from the vibrant city center of Sarande, the location strikes a perfect balance between peaceful retreat and access to urban excitement. Culinary enthusiasts will appreciate the proximity to the nearest restaurant, just 50 meters away, with a variety of dining options and bars within a 1-km radius, catering to diverse tastes and preferences.

For those intrigued by cultural and natural attractions, the vicinity does not disappoint. The historic St. George Monastery and the scenic Butrint Lake are both within a 5 km reach, while the ancient town of Butrint, a testament to the area's rich heritage, is located 10 km away.

Travelers concerned about mobility will find solace in the availability of a car rental service directly from the property, upon prior request. This thoughtful amenity ensures that guests have the freedom to explore the surrounding beauty at their leisure.
