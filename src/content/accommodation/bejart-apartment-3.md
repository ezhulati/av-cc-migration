The air-conditioned space is thoughtfully designed, boasting a bedroom, a living area with a flat-screen TV, a dining space, and a fully equipped kitchen complete with an oven. The addition of a private entrance enhances the sense of exclusivity, allowing guests to unwind with a selection of wine or champagne in privacy.

Morning risers are greeted with an Italian breakfast, a delightful spread of fruits and juice, ensuring a refreshing start to the day. The convenience continues with the presence of a coffee shop and a minimarket on-site, catering to guests' needs without the necessity to venture far.
