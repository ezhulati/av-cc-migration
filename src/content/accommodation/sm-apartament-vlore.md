Guests stepping into the apartment are greeted by a generously sized living space, bathed in natural light and outfitted with a flat-screen TV for entertainment. The heart of the home, a fully equipped kitchen, awaits those who appreciate the art of cooking, featuring a dishwasher, oven, washing machine, microwave, and fridge to cater to every culinary need.

For those venturing from afar, the convenience of being located 150 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport adds to the appeal, making SM Apartament Vlore an ideal choice for travelers seeking a blend of comfort, convenience, and a touch of local charm.
