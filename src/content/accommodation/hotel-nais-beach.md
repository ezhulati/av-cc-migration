Each room is thoughtfully designed with a furnished balcony or terrace, ensuring a private outdoor space for every guest. The interiors boast modern amenities, including an LCD satellite TV and a minibar, with select rooms offering breathtaking sea views that promise to elevate the stay.

For essentials or a quick drink, guests need not venture far as a grocery store and a bar are located just 10 meters from the hotel's doorstep. Those interested in exploring the historical aspects of Durrës will find the ancient Durrës Amphitheatre within a short 600-meter stroll.

The property is conveniently positioned 2 km from the main Bus and Train Stations, with Tirana Airport 33 km away, and the vibrant center of Tirana 40 km distant, making it an accessible retreat for both local and international visitors.
