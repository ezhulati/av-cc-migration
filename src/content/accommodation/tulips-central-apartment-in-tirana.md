It includes a bedroom that promises restful nights, a living room designed for relaxation, and a fully equipped kitchen complete with an oven and coffee machine for culinary enthusiasts. The bathroom does not skimp on luxury either, offering a walk-in shower and complimentary toiletries. The inclusion of towels and bed linen adds a touch of home comfort, while the private entrance ensures guests' privacy is paramount.
