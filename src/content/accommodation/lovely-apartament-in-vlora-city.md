The apartment itself is a haven of space and light, featuring one well-appointed bedroom, a bathroom stocked with essential linens and towels, and a living area designed for relaxation. Entertainment is readily available through a flat-screen TV equipped with streaming services, ensuring guests are never short of options. The heart of the home, a fully equipped kitchen, invites guests to prepare meals at their leisure, while a dining area provides the perfect setting for a serene breakfast or a romantic dinner. Perhaps the jewel in the crown is the balcony, offering unobstructed sea views that promise to captivate any visitor.

For those everyday essentials, the convenience of a minimarket on the premises cannot be overstated.

Exploration is encouraged, with Ri Beach and Independence Square only a short drive away, presenting an opportunity to immerse oneself in the local culture and scenic beauty of the area. For international travelers, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is accessible, located 151 km from the apartment, making Lovely Apartment in Vlora City an excellent base for both short getaways and extended stays in this vibrant city.
