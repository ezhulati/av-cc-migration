The condo itself is a haven of comfort, equipped with a modern kitchen that includes an oven and toaster for those home-cooked meals, a cozy seating area perfect for unwinding, and a flat-screen TV for entertainment. The bedroom promises a restful night's sleep, while the bathroom comes complete with a bidet, ensuring a refreshing start to each day. Not to be overlooked, the balcony offers a private outdoor space where guests can enjoy breathtaking mountain views, complemented by outdoor furniture for that perfect morning coffee or evening relaxation. Designed with health in mind, the apartment is both allergy-free and strictly non-smoking.

For those looking to socialize or simply relax outside of their private quarters, a shared lounge area provides the perfect setting. And for guests arriving from afar, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is located 148 km away, making the Serene Green One-Bedroom Condo an accessible retreat for both local and international travelers seeking the ultimate Vlorë experience.
