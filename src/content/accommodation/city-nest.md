Guests can stay connected and entertained throughout their visit, thanks to the inclusion of free WiFi and a flat-screen TV. The apartment doesn't skimp on practical amenities either; a washing machine and a fully equipped kitchen, complete with an oven and toaster, make it easy for visitors to feel at home. The provision of towels and bed linen adds a touch of thoughtfulness to the accommodation, ensuring a comfortable stay.

Adding to the appeal of City Nest is the attention to guest privacy, highlighted by a private entrance to the apartment. For those looking to explore beyond Shkodër, Podgorica Airport is conveniently located 58 km away, making it an accessible option for international travelers.
