For those arriving by car, the convenience of free private parking is a notable perk, making excursions to nearby attractions hassle-free. The apartment is strategically positioned away from the smoke-filled environments, ensuring a clean and healthy stay just a stone's throw away from the House of Leaves, 4.3 km to be exact.

The living space is thoughtfully designed, featuring a single bedroom that promises a restful night's sleep, a fully equipped kitchen for those who love to cook, and a bathroom that caters to all your needs. Entertainment is readily available with a flat-screen TV, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration.

Not to be overlooked, the apartment's proximity to Rinia Park and the Clock Tower Tirana, both less than 5 km away, offers guests the opportunity to immerse themselves in the local culture and history. Moreover, with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport just 12 km away, View Apartment stands as an ideal choice for both domestic and international travelers looking for a blend of comfort, convenience, and a touch of local charm.
