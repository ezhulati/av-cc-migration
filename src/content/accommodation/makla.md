Adding to the charm of Makla is an on-site bar, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration. Guests are also invited to enjoy moments of tranquility in the property's lush garden, offering a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle.

Strategically located, Makla is a mere 400 meters from the VIP Beach, with Flamingo Beach slightly further at 600 meters, making it an ideal base for beach enthusiasts. For those traveling from afar, Ioannina Airport is the nearest gateway, located 97 km away, ensuring Makla is within reach for international and domestic travelers alike.
