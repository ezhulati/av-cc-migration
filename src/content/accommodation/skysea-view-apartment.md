Upon arrival, guests are greeted with the promise of a hassle-free stay, thanks to the 24-hour front desk, seamless airport transfer services, and the modern convenience of an elevator and complimentary WiFi. The apartment itself is a spacious sanctuary, boasting a balcony that offers captivating city views. It is thoughtfully designed with a comfortable bedroom, a cozy living room equipped with a flat-screen TV for entertainment, a fully equipped kitchen for those who love to cook, and a bathroom complete with a bidet and shower. For added convenience, an ironing service is readily available, ensuring that guests look their best with minimal effort.

For those who need to pick up essentials or snacks, a minimarket on the premises caters to those needs without having to leave the comfort of the apartment complex. Additionally, the availability of a car rental service directly from the apartment encourages guests to explore the surrounding area at their own pace, from the historic Skanderbeg Square located 39 km away to the adventurous Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, 43 km from the property.

Situated just 33 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, Sky&Sea View Apartment not only offers ease of access for international travelers but also serves as an ideal base for exploring the rich cultural tapestry and natural beauty of Durrës and its surroundings.
