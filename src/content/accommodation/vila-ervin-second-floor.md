Security is paramount, with round-the-clock surveillance, alongside the exclusivity of private check-in and check-out services, and the convenience of on-site currency exchange, ensuring a seamless and secure stay for all guests.

The apartment itself is a testament to modern living, boasting a bedroom, a bathroom, and comprehensive amenities including bed linen, towels, a flat-screen TV, and a dining area. The fully equipped kitchen caters to every culinary need, while the terrace offers breathtaking mountain views, providing a perfect backdrop for relaxation. The commitment to a non-smoking environment further enhances the quality of the guest experience.

For moments of tranquility, the garden offers a peaceful retreat. Despite its secluded feel, the property remains well-connected, with Corfu International Airport 92 km away, making it an accessible haven for both local and international visitors.

Vila Ervin Second Floor stands out as an exemplary choice for those in pursuit of a tranquil getaway, combining the comforts of home with the beauty of Ksamil's natural landscapes.
