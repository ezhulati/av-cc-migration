Adding to the appeal, most rooms boast balconies that offer breathtaking views of the sea, allowing guests to enjoy the serene landscape from the comfort of their rooms.

For those looking to unwind with a drink, the hotel's on-site bar serves as a cozy spot. The location is especially favorable for guests eager to explore local flavors, as a variety of restaurants, cafes, and shops are easily accessible on foot from the hotel.

Titania Hotel also caters to the adventurous spirit, providing bike and car hire services that invite guests to explore the surrounding area at their own pace. The Port of Sarandë is a mere 500 meters away, making it convenient for guests planning boat trips or excursions. Furthermore, the enchanting Butrint National Park lies just 19 km from the hotel, offering a glimpse into the area's rich history and natural beauty.

For international travelers, Corfu Airport is within a 33 km reach, making Titania Hotel a strategic location for those coming from afar. Although the hotel offers free public parking on-site, it's worth noting that spaces are available on a first-come, first-served basis, as reservations are not possible. This detail, however, is a small consideration in light of the hotel's comprehensive offerings and prime location, making it a compelling choice for visitors to Sarandë.
