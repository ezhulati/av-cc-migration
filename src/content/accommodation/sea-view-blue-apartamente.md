A mere 1.4 km from the inviting sands of Golem Beach and within a reasonable distance from notable landmarks such as Skanderbeg Square and the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, the apartment's location is unbeatable for explorers eager to uncover the rich tapestry of the area. The historic Durres Amphitheatre and the intriguing House of Leaves museum are also accessible, adding a dash of culture to your beach getaway.

The apartment itself is thoughtfully designed with guests' comfort in mind, featuring a bedroom that promises restful nights, a fully equipped kitchen for those inspired to cook, and a bathroom that provides a refreshing retreat.

Further afield, the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha presents an opportunity for a deeper dive into Albania's history, located 42 km from the apartment. Conveniently, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is just 36 km away, making Sea View Blue Apartamente an ideal base for both short stays and extended explorations in Durrës.
