It features a well-appointed bedroom, a fully equipped kitchen complete with a microwave and fridge, and a cozy seating area perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration. The inclusion of a flat-screen TV ensures entertainment is always at hand, while the private bathroom, stocked with fresh towels and bed linen, adds an extra layer of convenience.

What sets Getaway Apartments apart is not just its amenities but also its proximity to Tirana's cultural heartbeat. Guests find themselves moments away from significant landmarks such as the National Museum of History Albania, the Clock Tower Tirana, and the Et'hem Bey Mosque, making it an ideal base for those eager to dive into the city's rich history.

For those interested in the more recent past, the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha and the House of Leaves are nearby, offering a glimpse into Albania's communist era. Meanwhile, Rinia Park provides a green oasis in the urban landscape, perfect for leisurely strolls or picnics.

With Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport just 13 km away, Getaway Apartments ensures a hassle-free arrival and departure, cementing its status as a top choice for both short visits and extended stays in Albania's vibrant capital.
