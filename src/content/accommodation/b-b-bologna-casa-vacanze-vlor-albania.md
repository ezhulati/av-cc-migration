This inviting space is equipped with a flat-screen TV in its airy bedroom, complemented by a modern bathroom, ensuring a comfortable stay. The highlight for many, however, is the inclusion of a private kitchen, perfect for those moments when the allure of a home-cooked meal is preferred over the local dining scene.

Adding to the appeal is the commitment to guest security, with full-day security measures in place, alongside the convenience of complimentary WiFi and private parking. The non-smoking premises further underscore the property's dedication to providing a comfortable and health-conscious environment.

For explorers eager to venture beyond the immediate comforts of their accommodation, the mystical Kuzum Baba awaits at a distance of 2.9 km, promising an enriching cultural experience. Moreover, the establishment's location ensures that the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, 150 km away, is within a manageable distance for international travelers.

B&B Bologna Casa Vacanze Vlorë Albania thus stands out as a prime choice for those in pursuit of a peaceful getaway that does not compromise on accessibility to Vlorë's rich tapestry of beaches, historical sites, and cultural landmarks.
