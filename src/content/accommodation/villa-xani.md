Guests at Villa Xani are treated to accommodations that blend functionality with comfort. Each unit is equipped with air conditioning, a flat-screen TV with satellite channels, a refrigerator, and a coffee machine, ensuring a stay that combines relaxation with the comforts of home. For those who love to prepare their own meals, select rooms also feature a fully equipped kitchen, complete with an oven. The attention to detail extends to the provision of plush bathrobes, a wardrobe, and a private bathroom outfitted with a shower and hair dryer, enhancing the home-away-from-home experience.

The allure of Villa Xani is not limited to its interiors. A balcony accompanies each accommodation, offering guests a private vista of the surrounding mountains, while the property itself boasts a terrace and a lush garden equipped with a barbecue. This setting invites guests to unwind in nature or engage in outdoor activities, with fishing and hiking opportunities readily available nearby.

For beach enthusiasts, the property's location is ideal. Beyond the nearby Spille Beach, Livadhi Beach and Maracit Beach are both within a 1.3 km radius, offering diverse options for sun, sea, and sand. Despite its tranquil setting, Villa Xani remains accessible, with Ioannina Airport located 144 km away, making it a convenient retreat for both local and international travelers.

In summary, Villa Xani stands out as a versatile accommodation choice, promising a blend of comfort, convenience, and natural beauty for families and solo travelers alike. Its comprehensive amenities, coupled with its proximity to some of Himare's most beautiful beaches, make it a compelling option for anyone looking to explore this picturesque part of the world.
