For those looking to explore the area at their own pace, a car rental service is readily available on-site, making local excursions both easy and accessible. The property's proximity to historical and cultural landmarks, such as the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, located just 2.5 km away, and the Rock of Kavaje, 44 km away, positions it as an ideal base for cultural exploration. Furthermore, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is conveniently situated 16 km from the apartments, ensuring ease of travel to and from the destination.
