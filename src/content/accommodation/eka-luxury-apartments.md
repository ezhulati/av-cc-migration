The apartments are designed with inclusivity in mind, offering family-friendly rooms and accessible facilities for guests with disabilities, ensuring a welcoming experience for all. The interior of each unit reveals a thoughtful layout, equipped with air conditioning for those warm Mediterranean days, and a seating area perfect for unwinding. Entertainment is readily available via a flat-screen TV complete with streaming services, alongside a fully equipped kitchen and dining area for those who prefer a home-cooked meal. Safety and privacy are prioritized with the inclusion of a safety deposit box and a private bathroom, complete with a bidet, slippers, and a hair dryer, adding a touch of home comfort to the luxury experience.

The allure of EKA Luxury Apartments is further enhanced by the terraces featured in every unit. These outdoor spaces offer not only an area for dining al fresco but also boast breathtaking mountain views, providing a serene backdrop for morning coffees or evening relaxation. The attention to detail extends to the provision of bed linen and towels in each unit, ensuring a comfortable and hassle-free stay.

Located a mere 400 meters from the picturesque Durres Beach and within a manageable distance from Skanderbeg Square, the apartments offer an ideal base for exploring the rich history and natural beauty of the area. For those arriving from afar, the convenience of a paid airport shuttle service from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 33 km away, is a testament to EKA Luxury Apartments' dedication to guest satisfaction.

EKA Luxury Apartments emerges as a top choice for discerning travelers, combining the comforts of home with the luxury of a 5-star hotel, all set against the vibrant backdrop of Durrës.
