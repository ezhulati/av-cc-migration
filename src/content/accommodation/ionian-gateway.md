The apartment itself is a testament to modern living, boasting two well-appointed bedrooms and bathrooms, ensuring ample space for guests. The inclusion of bed linen, towels, a flat-screen TV with satellite channels, and a fully equipped kitchen speaks to the thoughtful touches designed to make stays as comfortable as possible. Perhaps the most captivating feature is the balcony that presents breathtaking mountain views, offering a serene spot to dine outdoors and soak in the city's beauty. The promise of soundproof accommodations further guarantees a peaceful retreat from the bustling city life.

For those looking to explore beyond the immediate surroundings, VIP Beach is just 2.2 km away, offering a more exclusive seaside experience. Meanwhile, the historical allure of Butrint National Park is within a 16 km reach, presenting an opportunity to immerse in the region's rich heritage. The nearest airport, Ioannina Airport, is 96 km away, making Ionian Gateway accessible for international and domestic travelers alike.

While the convenience of on-site private parking comes with an additional fee, the availability of free WiFi throughout the property ensures that guests remain connected and entertained throughout their stay.

Ionian Gateway not only offers a strategic location and comprehensive amenities but also serves as a gateway to the enchanting landscapes and cultural richness of Sarandë, making it an ideal choice for travelers looking for a blend of relaxation and exploration.
