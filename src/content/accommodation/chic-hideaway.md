The apartment itself is a haven of modern comforts. Guests can enjoy the convenience of free WiFi, a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a washing machine for longer stays. The fully equipped kitchen, featuring a minibar, allows for the easy preparation of meals, ensuring a home-away-from-home experience. Importantly, the accommodation maintains a non-smoking policy, ensuring a clean and fresh environment for all guests.

For those looking to venture further, the Rock of Kavaje is 40 km away, offering an excellent day trip opportunity, while the House of Leaves, located just 2.9 km from the property, presents a fascinating visit. Conveniently, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is only 11 km away, making Chic Hideaway an ideal choice for both short visits and extended stays in Tirana. Though private parking is available at an extra charge, the ease of access to local attractions and the airport more than compensates for this.

In summary, Chic Hideaway in Tirana is a standout choice for travelers seeking a blend of comfort, convenience, and the opportunity to immerse themselves in the local culture and history.
