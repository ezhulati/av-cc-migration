Each apartment within the complex is thoughtfully designed with guest convenience in mind, featuring essential amenities such as a wardrobe, a private bathroom with a shower and hair dryer, a flat-screen TV, air conditioning, and, for added comfort, selected rooms also include a seating area. To further enhance the stay, every unit is furnished with bed linen and towels, emphasizing the property's attention to detail.

Beyond the confines of their apartments, guests are encouraged to unwind in the tranquil garden, a perfect spot for relaxation and reflection. Despite its secluded feel, Vila Riand remains accessible, with Ioannina Airport located 125 km away, making it a feasible destination for both local and international travelers.
