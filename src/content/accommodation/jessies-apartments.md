The apartment itself boasts a generous layout, featuring two well-appointed bedrooms, a living space enhanced by a flat-screen TV with streaming services, and a balcony that presents captivating city views. The inclusion of a fully equipped kitchen, complete with a microwave and fridge, alongside a washing machine, ensures a home-away-from-home experience. The convenience of two bathrooms, each with a bidet, adds to the comfort of the stay. Notably, the apartment is designed to be non-smoking and soundproof, providing a peaceful retreat in the bustling city.

For those intrigued by history, the proximity to the Durres Amphitheatre, just 400 meters away, offers a glimpse into the past, while the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha stands as a testament to the country's unique history, both located 40 km from the accommodation. Adventure seekers can venture further to the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, 43 km away, or explore the natural beauty surrounding the Rock of Kavaje, 12 km from the apartment.

Accessibility is a breeze with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport situated 34 km away, complemented by the convenience of a paid airport shuttle service offered by Jessie's Apartments. This property not only promises a stay filled with exploration and discovery but also ensures a comfortable and convenient base for every traveler venturing into DurrÃ«s.
