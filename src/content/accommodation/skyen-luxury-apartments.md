The apartment itself is a testament to contemporary living, featuring a cozy living room equipped with a flat-screen TV and streaming services for entertainment at any time. The kitchen doesn't disappoint, boasting full equipment including a dishwasher and oven, catering to every culinary need. The bathroom is modern, offering a walk-in shower, while the provision of towels and bed linen ensures a comfortable stay. Notably, the apartment guarantees privacy with its own entrance, making it a secluded haven.

For those looking to explore, a car rental service directly from the apartment opens up endless possibilities. The iconic Skanderbeg Square and the adventurous Dajti Ekspres Cable Car are within reach, located 39 km and 43 km away, respectively. Moreover, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, just 33 km away, makes Skyen Luxury Apartments an ideal choice for both international and domestic travelers seeking a blend of comfort and convenience in Durrës.
