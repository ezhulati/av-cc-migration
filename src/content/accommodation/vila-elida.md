Each room is a testament to thoughtful hospitality, equipped with a fully functional kitchen that includes a dishwasher, creating a home-away-from-home atmosphere. The living spaces are complemented by a flat-screen TV, a washing machine, and a private bathroom outfitted with a bidet and slippers for ultimate comfort. Select units elevate the guest experience further, offering balconies that provide an outdoor dining area and breathtaking mountain views, alongside ample storage with built-in wardrobes.

Vila Elida extends its hospitality outdoors with barbecue facilities, inviting guests to enjoy al fresco dining amidst the beauty of its well-manicured garden or to venture out for a picnic in the designated area, embracing the tranquility of its natural surroundings.

Situated a mere 22 km from the historical landmarks of Kuzum Baba and Independence Square, Vila Elida serves as an ideal base for explorers keen to immerse themselves in the local culture. For those traveling to and from the area, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is located 171 km away, making Vila Elida a convenient and compelling choice for both domestic and international travelers seeking a peaceful retreat.
