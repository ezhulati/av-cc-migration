The villa itself is a masterpiece of comfort and style, featuring a generous layout that includes four elegantly appointed bedrooms, two expansive living rooms, and a terrace that offers breathtaking mountain vistas. Modern amenities such as a flat-screen TV, a fully equipped kitchen with a dishwasher and an oven, and three pristine bathrooms with walk-in showers elevate the living experience. The attention to detail is evident in the soundproofed rooms adorned with parquet floors and a cozy fireplace, ensuring a serene and comfortable stay. Guests are also provided with the convenience of bed linen, towels, and an ironing service.

Outside, the villa's garden becomes a haven of relaxation and leisure, complete with a barbecue area for memorable outdoor dining experiences. For those with an adventurous spirit, the proximity to fishing spots adds an element of excitement to the stay.

Notably, Villa Salo is strategically positioned within reach of notable attractions, including the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, 47 km away, and the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, 44 km away. For guests arriving by air, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is conveniently located 57 km from the villa, making travel arrangements seamless.

Villa Salo not only promises a stay that is as restful as it is enriching but also stands as a testament to the elegance and charm of Labinot-Fushë.
