The villa itself is a haven of tranquility, boasting two well-appointed bedrooms and a bathroom, complemented by essential amenities such as bed linen, towels, and a flat-screen TV with cable channels. The heart of the home is its fully equipped kitchen and dining area, perfect for guests who enjoy preparing their meals. Perhaps one of its most delightful features is the balcony, offering views of a quiet street, ideal for those moments of reflection or enjoying a meal in the outdoor dining area. The property has been thoughtfully designed with guest privacy in mind, featuring a private entrance and soundproofing to ensure a peaceful stay.

Just a stone's throw away, the Durres Amphitheatre and the House of Leaves invite exploration, enriching guests' stay with a touch of history and culture. Conveniently, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is merely 32 km away, making Vacation Villa an accessible choice for international and domestic travelers alike.

In essence, Vacation Villa is more than just a place to stay; it's a gateway to experiencing the rich tapestry of Durrës and its surroundings, promising a memorable getaway for those who seek both relaxation and adventure.
