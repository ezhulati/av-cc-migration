The apartment itself is a testament to thoughtful accommodation, featuring a single bedroom that promises restful nights. The kitchen is well-equipped with an oven and microwave, catering to guests' culinary needs, while the living space includes a flat-screen TV and comfortable seating area, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration. The convenience of a modern bathroom, complete with a walk-in shower, towels, and bed linen, adds to the homely feel of the apartment.

For those looking to venture further, Skanderbeg Square lies 39 km away, offering a glimpse into the local culture and history. The Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, 43 km from the apartment, provides an opportunity for an unforgettable aerial view of the area. Moreover, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, just 33 km away, ensures that travel logistics are straightforward for international guests.

Durres Lovely Apartment not only offers a comfortable stay but also serves as a gateway to the rich experiences that Durrës and its surroundings have to offer.
