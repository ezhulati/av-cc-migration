The apartment itself is a haven of tranquility, boasting soundproof rooms that promise a peaceful retreat from the bustling city life. A mere 1.8 km away from the historical Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, it offers a unique blend of modern amenities and a nod to the area's rich history. The accommodation features a generously sized living space, complete with a balcony that presents serene garden views. Guests can enjoy the comforts of home with a satellite flat-screen TV, a fully equipped kitchen, and a bathroom that includes a walk-in shower and a bidet. For added convenience, towels and linens are available upon request.

For those needing to pick up essentials or snacks, a minimarket on the premises caters to those needs effortlessly. While the Rock of Kavaje is a bit further afield, the Pyramid of Tirana is an easy 2 km journey, making it an accessible spot for an afternoon excursion. For guests arriving by air, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is just 14 km away, with the apartment offering a paid shuttle service for a seamless travel experience.

Franci's Apartment not only provides a comfortable and convenient base for exploring Tirana but also ensures a stay that is as relaxing as it is enriching.
