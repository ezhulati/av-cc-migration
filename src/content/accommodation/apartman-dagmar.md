The apartment itself is a spacious haven, boasting a terrace that offers breathtaking sea views. Designed to accommodate the needs of modern travelers, it features two well-appointed bedrooms, a cozy living room complete with a flat-screen TV, and a kitchenette equipped with an oven and microwave for those home-cooked meals. The inclusion of a bathroom with a bidet, along with towels and bed linen, adds to the convenience factor, ensuring a home-away-from-home experience.

Dining at Apartmán Dagmar is an experience in itself, with the on-site restaurant catering to a variety of tastes for dinner, lunch, brunch, and even cocktails, making it a perfect spot for family meals or casual dining.

For families, the children's playground is a thoughtful addition, ensuring that the little ones are entertained throughout their stay.

Located just 4.5 km from the Rock of Kavaje and 39 km from the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, guests are perfectly positioned to explore the rich cultural tapestry of the area. Moreover, with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport only 33 km away, accessibility is never an issue.

In summary, Apartmán Dagmar offers a compelling choice for travelers seeking a blend of serenity, convenience, and a touch of local flavor, making it a standout option for those visiting Durrës.
