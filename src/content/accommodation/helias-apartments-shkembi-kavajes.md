The apartment complex caters to families and groups with its spacious family rooms, each air-conditioned for comfort in the Mediterranean climate. The highlight of these apartments is undoubtedly the fully equipped kitchen in every unit, providing guests with the freedom to craft their own culinary experiences during their stay. The convenience of a private bathroom, complete with a bidet and hair dryer, adds to the home-away-from-home feel, complemented by the provision of free WiFi across the premises. Select units further enhance the stay with the inclusion of a balcony, offering a private outdoor space to unwind.

For those incidental needs or quick snacks, the on-site minimarket proves incredibly convenient. Guests looking to explore beyond the immediate comforts of their apartment will find Golem Beach just a short drive away, offering another picturesque option for sun-seekers. The cultural heart of Albania, Skanderbeg Square, is accessible at 41 km, presenting an opportunity for a day trip into the historical and vibrant capital city. For international travelers, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 35 km away, ensures a hassle-free arrival and departure.

Helia's Apartments Shkembi Kavajes stands out as an ideal choice for travelers seeking a blend of independence, comfort, and accessibility in their Durrës accommodation.
