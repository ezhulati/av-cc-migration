The guesthouse features a well-appointed apartment that includes a bedroom, a fully equipped kitchen with an oven and fridge, and a cozy seating area perfect for unwinding. Entertainment needs are met with a flat-screen TV, and the inclusion of a bathroom with a bath ensures a relaxing stay. One of the highlights is the opportunity to dine al fresco in the outdoor dining area, where guests can savor their meals against the backdrop of breathtaking sea views. The added charm of a fireplace elevates the experience, making it ideal for cooler evenings.

Situated a mere 2 kilometers from Liro Beach and close to the historical Kuzum Baba at 5.5 kilometers, the guesthouse's location allows for easy exploration of Vlorë's attractions. For those traveling further afield, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is 155 kilometers away, making Biku Guesthouse on the Hill a compelling choice for both local and international visitors. Independence Square, a notable landmark, is also within easy reach at 5.7 kilometers from the property, rounding off the convenience and appeal of this charming accommodation.
