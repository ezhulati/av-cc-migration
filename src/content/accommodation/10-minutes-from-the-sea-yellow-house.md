The villa itself is a spacious haven, boasting four well-appointed bedrooms, a kitchen equipped with modern appliances including an oven and a fridge, and two lavish bathrooms complete with a hot tub, bathrobes, and a washing machine. The inclusion of a balcony that serves as an outdoor dining area adds a touch of elegance, offering guests garden views that promise tranquility.

For those who might need to pick up essentials or snacks, a convenient minimarket is located on the premises. The villa's location also makes it an ideal base for visiting notable attractions such as the Rock of Kavaje, 37 km away, and the historical Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, 40 km from the villa. Moreover, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is easily accessible, located just 26 km away, making the 10 Minutes from the Sea Yellow House an excellent choice for travelers seeking both comfort and convenience in Durrës.
