Guests are welcomed into a space that feels like home, featuring two cozy bedrooms, each air-conditioned to ensure a restful night's sleep even on the warmest nights. The living space extends onto a terrace, inviting guests to enjoy their morning coffee or evening relaxation outdoors. The inclusion of a fully equipped kitchen caters to those who prefer the flexibility of preparing their own meals, adding a touch of personalization to the stay. Entertainment needs are met with a flat-screen TV, perfect for unwinding after a day of adventure.

For those traveling by air, the convenience of being located just 83 km from Ioannina Airport reduces the stress of long travel days. With both Wi-Fi and parking available at no extra cost, Twins House Gjirokaster ensures that every aspect of your stay is as effortless as it is enjoyable.
