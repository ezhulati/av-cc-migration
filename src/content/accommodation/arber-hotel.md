Each air-conditioned room is a blend of sophistication and functionality, equipped with an LCD cable TV to ensure guests stay entertained and connected. The thoughtful addition of a minibar in every room adds a touch of luxury, making your stay even more enjoyable.

Attention to detail is evident in the private bathrooms, which are outfitted with a shower, hairdryer, and complimentary toiletries, ensuring a seamless and comfortable experience for all guests.

For those looking to explore beyond the city's confines, the Arber Hotel serves as an ideal base. Located merely 500 meters from Tirana's main bus and train stations, guests have easy access to the wider region. The historic town of Krujë and the coastal city of Durrës, both within a 35 km radius, are perfect for day trips, offering a glimpse into Albania's rich history and stunning landscapes.

In summary, the Arber Hotel stands out as a prime choice for travelers who value both the vibrancy of city life and the serenity of a comfortable retreat.
