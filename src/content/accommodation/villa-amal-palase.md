The highlight of Villa Amal Palase is undoubtedly its spacious apartment. Adorned with a terrace that offers panoramic views of the azure waters, the apartment is thoughtfully designed to cater to every need. It houses two cozy bedrooms, a welcoming living room equipped with a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a fully equipped kitchen featuring modern amenities such as a dishwasher and an oven. The convenience of a private bathroom with a bidet adds to the comfort of the stay. Guests have the luxury of dining al fresco in the outdoor dining area, making the most of the tranquil garden views. The commitment to guest privacy is evident in the thoughtful touches like a private entrance and soundproofing throughout the accommodation.

For those looking to explore the area at their own pace, Villa Amal Palase offers a car rental service, making local excursions more accessible. Despite its peaceful location, the property is within a reasonable distance from Ioannina Airport, situated 168 km away, making it a viable option for both domestic and international travelers seeking a picturesque escape on the Albanian coast.
