The apartment itself is a testament to thoughtful design and comfort, boasting a well-appointed bedroom, a fully equipped kitchen complete with an oven and fridge, and a cozy seating area. The highlight, however, is the bathroom fitted with a hot tub, promising relaxation after a day of exploration. The inclusion of a flat-screen TV ensures entertainment is always at hand. Perhaps the most captivating feature is the outdoor dining area, allowing guests to dine al fresco while soaking in breathtaking sea views, all from the privacy of their own balcony.

Located 50 km from the historic Skanderbeg Square and a mere 8.5 km from the intriguing Rock of Kavaje, Nova Apartments Qerret K4 serves as an ideal base for those looking to immerse themselves in the local culture and natural beauty. With Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport just 44 km away, accessibility is another feather in its cap, making it a compelling choice for both domestic and international travelers seeking a blend of tranquility, convenience, and luxury by the sea.
