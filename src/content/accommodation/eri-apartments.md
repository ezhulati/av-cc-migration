The living spaces are thoughtfully designed, offering balconies for soaking in the surroundings or, in select units, terraces that elevate the experience with stunning sea views. The heart of each apartment, the fully equipped kitchen with an oven, invites guests to feel at home, while conveniences like a flat-screen TV, washing machine, and private bathrooms equipped with showers and hair dryers add to the ease of the stay. The attention to detail extends to the provision of kettles in all units, alongside bed linen and towels, ensuring every need is met.

For those looking to explore beyond the comfort of Eri Apartments, the historic allure of Butrint National Park awaits just 13 km away, offering a glimpse into the area's rich past. Further afield, Ancient Fanoti is 47 km away, promising an adventure for history enthusiasts. The nearest airport, Ioannina Airport, is located 97 km from the property, making Eri Apartments an accessible escape for both domestic and international travelers.
