Guests are welcomed into a generously sized living space, featuring two well-appointed bedrooms, a sleek flat-screen TV, and a balcony perfect for soaking in the local ambiance. The heart of the apartment is its fully equipped kitchen, where visitors can find everything from a dishwasher and oven to a washing machine, fridge, and stovetop, making self-catering a breeze. The inclusion of towels and bed linen adds a touch of homey comfort, while the outdoor dining area invites guests to enjoy meals under the open sky.

Situated 153 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, Kai's Apartment is not just a place to stay but a launchpad for exploring the enchanting city of Vlorë and its surrounding beauty.
