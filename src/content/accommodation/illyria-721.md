The accommodation itself is a spacious apartment that boasts a balcony offering unobstructed sea views, creating the perfect backdrop for a tranquil stay. Guests will find the apartment well-appointed with two bedrooms, a cozy living room, a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a fully equipped kitchen featuring an oven and a microwave. The convenience extends to the bathroom equipped with a bidet, and the provision of towels and bed linen, ensuring a comfortable and hassle-free stay. It's noteworthy that the apartment maintains a non-smoking policy, catering to the comfort and well-being of all guests.

For those minor necessities or quick snacks, the apartment houses a minimarket, adding an extra layer of convenience to your stay. While the allure of the beachfront location is undeniable, guests also find themselves within a manageable distance from other attractions, including the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, located 43 km away, and the Rock of Kavaje, merely 4.4 km from the property. For travelers, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, situated 33 km away, makes Illyria 721 an accessible and appealing choice for both short and extended stays in Durrës.
