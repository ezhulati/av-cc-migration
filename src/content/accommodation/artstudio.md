The accommodation itself boasts two elegantly appointed bedrooms, ensuring a restful night's sleep for all who stay. Entertainment is readily available through a flat-screen TV equipped with streaming services, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration. The villa's kitchen is a culinary enthusiast's dream, featuring a dishwasher, an oven, and a washing machine, making both cooking and cleanup a breeze. The inclusion of a private bathroom equipped with either a bath or shower adds an extra layer of convenience to the stay.

Upon entering the villa through its private entrance, guests are greeted with a thoughtful offering of fruits, a small but telling gesture of the hospitality that awaits them. The outdoor dining area invites guests to enjoy their meals al fresco, adding an element of charm to every dining experience.
