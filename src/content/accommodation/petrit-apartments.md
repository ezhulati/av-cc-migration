Each apartment is thoughtfully equipped with a fully functional kitchen, complete with a dining table, ensuring guests have everything they need for a self-sufficient stay. Entertainment is readily available through the inclusion of a TV with cable channels, and the convenience of a private bathroom, outfitted with a shower, slippers, and a hair dryer, adds an extra layer of comfort to the guest experience. The option to enjoy meals in an outdoor dining area enhances the appeal, offering a delightful setting for dining al fresco.

For those looking to venture beyond the immediate comforts of their accommodation, Butrint National Park lies 18 km away, presenting an opportunity for exploration and adventure. Additionally, the proximity to Ioannina Airport, located 98 km from Petrit Apartments, facilitates ease of travel to and from the property. This combination of thoughtful amenities, strategic location, and the promise of both relaxation and adventure makes Petrit Apartments a highly recommended stay for visitors to Sarande.
