The apartment itself is a testament to spacious living, boasting a bedroom that promises restful nights, a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a fully equipped kitchen ready to cater to culinary adventures with an oven, fridge, washing machine, and stovetop. The inclusion of towels and bed linen adds a touch of home, while the private entrance ensures an undisturbed stay.

For essentials or quick snacks, a minimarket on the premises meets guests' needs with ease. Those inclined towards outdoor activities will find the option of cycling nearby invigorating, or they can simply relish the tranquility of the garden.

Strategically positioned, Summer Bliss Seaside Apartment is not only moments away from the beach but also within manageable distances from notable attractions. The Dajti Ekspres Cable Car awaits 42 km away, offering breathtaking views, while the Rock of Kavaje is a mere 6.4 km from the doorstep. For international travelers, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is conveniently 33 km away, making arrivals and departures as smooth as the sea breeze.
