For leisure, guests have the option to engage in a game of darts on-site, or explore the surrounding area on two wheels with bike hire services. Car hire is also available for those looking to venture further afield.

The apartment's location is ideal for culture enthusiasts and explorers alike, with proximity to notable attractions such as the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, the National Museum of History Albania, and the House of Leaves.
