Unique Traditional House ensures a memorable stay with its array of amenities. The villa boasts two cozy bedrooms, a bathroom stocked with essentials, and a living space designed for relaxation. The inclusion of a flat-screen TV with streaming services, a dining area, a fully equipped kitchen, and a patio overlooking a lush garden enhances the home-away-from-home experience. The outdoor dining area and a fireplace add a touch of luxury to evenings spent indoors, while the private entrance and round-the-clock security ensure peace of mind throughout the stay.

For those traveling with family, the villa does not disappoint. A children's playground on the premises promises fun for younger guests, and the location is perfect for outdoor enthusiasts, with cycling and fishing opportunities just around the corner. The convenience of a minimarket at the villa adds to the ease of your stay.

Located 42 km from the Rock of Kavaje and a mere 2.6 km from the House of Leaves, Unique Traditional House is ideally positioned for exploring Tirana's rich cultural landscape. The nearest airport, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, is only 13 km away, making arrivals and departures a breeze with the added benefit of airport transfers and car rental services available upon request.
