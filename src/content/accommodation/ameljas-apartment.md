The apartment itself is a testament to spacious living, boasting two well-appointed bedrooms and two bathrooms, ensuring ample space for guests. The inclusion of bed linen, towels, a flat-screen TV equipped with streaming services, a dining area, a fully equipped kitchen, and a balcony offering serene views of the inner courtyard, elevates the living experience. Guests are welcomed with the thoughtful touch of chocolates or cookies, adding a personal flair to the warm hospitality on offer. Importantly, the accommodation maintains a strict non-smoking policy, ensuring a pleasant environment for all guests.

For those needing essentials or a quick snack, the convenience of an on-site minimarket is a notable perk. Additionally, the proximity to Podgorica Airport, located 58 km away, makes Amelja's Apartment a strategic choice for both short and extended stays. This property not only promises a comfortable stay but also delivers a memorable experience in the heart of Shkodër.
