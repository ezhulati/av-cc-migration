The apartment itself is a study in comfort and convenience, featuring a balcony that offers unobstructed sea views - a perfect backdrop for morning coffees or evening reflections. Inside, guests will find a cozy bedroom, a welcoming living room equipped with a flat-screen TV for those leisurely days in, and a fully equipped kitchen with a microwave and fridge, catering to all culinary needs. The inclusion of a modern bathroom with a bidet, along with the provision of towels and bed linen, underscores the property's commitment to guest comfort.

Notably, Apartmán Hany is located just 6.6 km from the Rock of Kavaje, offering an easy escape to one of the area's natural wonders. Additionally, the property is 38 km from the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, providing a unique glimpse into the country's history. For those traveling by air, the convenience of being 32 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport adds to the appeal.

In essence, Apartmán Hany is more than just a place to stay; it's a gateway to experiencing the beauty and history of Durrës, all from the comfort of a beachfront apartment that feels like home.
