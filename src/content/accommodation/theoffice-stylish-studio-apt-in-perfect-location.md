Inside, the apartment boasts a single bedroom, but what sets it apart is the fully equipped kitchen, complete with a dishwasher and an oven, not to mention the convenience of having a washing machine. The bathroom is well-appointed with a hair dryer, and guests will appreciate the thoughtful provision of towels and bed linen. The added benefit of a private entrance enhances the sense of privacy and exclusivity.

For those who like to have amenities close at hand, there is a supermarket conveniently located near TheOffice. The apartment's prime location also means that guests are just a stone's throw away from some of Tirana's most sought-after attractions, including Skanderbeg Square, the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, and Rinia Park. For travelers, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, just 15 km away, makes TheOffice an ideal choice for both short and extended stays in Tirana.
