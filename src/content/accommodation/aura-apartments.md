The kitchen is ready to cater to any culinary need, featuring an oven, toaster, washing machine, fridge, and stovetop. Comfort is further accentuated with the provision of fresh towels and bed linen, ensuring a homely experience. It's worth noting, the premises are dedicated to providing a smoke-free environment.

Situated in a location that's both tranquil and central, Aura Apartments is just a stone's throw away from some of Tirana's most notable attractions. Guests can easily access Skanderbeg Square for a dive into the local culture, the historical Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, and Rinia Park for a leisurely stroll.
