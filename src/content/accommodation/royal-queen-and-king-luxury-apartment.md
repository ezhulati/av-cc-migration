The apartment itself is a testament to luxury living, boasting two well-appointed bedrooms, a bathroom equipped with a walk-in shower, and a dressing room designed for utmost privacy. The inclusion of bed linen, towels, a flat-screen TV with streaming services, a dining area, and a fully equipped kitchen underscores the property's commitment to a home-away-from-home experience. Additionally, the air-conditioned unit's soundproofing ensures a tranquil retreat for every guest.

On-site amenities further elevate the stay experience. Guests have the luxury of choosing from a restaurant, coffee shop, and bar without needing to step out of the comfort zone the Royal Queen and King Luxury Apartment provides. For those looking to unwind, the apartment doesn't disappoint, offering beauty services, a fitness room, and yoga classes. Moreover, the opportunity to explore the locale through sightseeing tours adds an adventurous twist to the stay.

Strategically located, the apartment is a stone's throw away from popular attractions such as Sarande Main Beach, Saranda City Beach, and La Petite Beach. For guests arriving from afar, the convenience of a paid airport shuttle service from Ioannina Airport, located 97 km away, is available.

In essence, Royal Queen and King Luxury Apartment stands out as a sophisticated sanctuary for travelers desiring both relaxation and exploration in the heart of Sarandë.
