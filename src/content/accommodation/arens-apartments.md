Accessibility is a priority at Arens Apartments, with facilities designed to accommodate disabled guests, ensuring a comfortable stay for all. The apartment itself is a testament to spacious living, featuring a bedroom, a living room, a fully equipped kitchen, and a bathroom, all designed with the guest's comfort in mind. Entertainment needs are also catered to with the inclusion of a flat-screen TV, making it an ideal retreat for relaxation after a day of adventure.

Located just a stone's throw away from the serene Shëngjin Beach, and less than a kilometer from the picturesque Ylberi Beach, the apartment's location is perfect for beach enthusiasts looking to soak up the sun and sea. For those traveling from afar, the convenience is further enhanced by the availability of a paid airport shuttle service from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 48 km away, ensuring a seamless travel experience from arrival to departure.

Arens Apartments not only offers a stay but an experience, making it a highly recommended choice for those visiting Shëngjin.
