The apartment itself is thoughtfully designed with guests' needs in mind, featuring a bedroom that promises restful nights, a fully equipped kitchen for those who enjoy the art of cooking, and a bathroom that caters to the essentials of daily living. Entertainment is also on hand with the inclusion of a flat-screen TV, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration.

For those looking to venture further, Kuzum Baba offers a glimpse into the local culture just 2.4 km away, while the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 149 km from the apartment, facilitates ease of travel to and from the city. Blue Apartment Vlore stands out as a compelling choice for visitors to Vlorë, combining the comforts of home with the excitement of travel.
