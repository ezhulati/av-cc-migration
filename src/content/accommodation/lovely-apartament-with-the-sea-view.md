The interior of the apartment is thoughtfully designed to accommodate guests' needs, featuring two bedrooms, a cozy living room with a flat-screen TV, and a fully equipped kitchen boasting an oven and fridge. The inclusion of a bathroom with a bidet adds to the comfort. For those requiring them, towels and linens are available upon request. Beyond the comfort of the indoors, guests are treated to stunning mountain views, adding to the serene atmosphere of the location.

Dining at the apartment is a delightful experience, with an on-site family-friendly restaurant catering to various meals including dinner, lunch, and brunch. The outdoor fireplace provides a perfect setting for guests to unwind after a day of cycling or exploring the nearby attractions.

The apartment's proximity to Vjetër Beach, just a few steps away, and Vlore Beach, located 2.5 km from the property, makes it an ideal spot for beach enthusiasts. For those traveling from afar, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is 151 km away, making Lovely Apartment with Sea View an accessible retreat for both local and international visitors.
