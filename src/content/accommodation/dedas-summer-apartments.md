Entertainment is readily available through the flat-screen TV with cable channels, ensuring guests are never at a loss for things to do.

The attention to detail extends to the private bathrooms, which are outfitted with a bath and a hairdryer, adding an extra layer of convenience to the stay. For those needing to attend to business matters, the provision of a desk in each unit is a thoughtful touch.
