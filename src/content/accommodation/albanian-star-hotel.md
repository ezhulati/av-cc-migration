Entertainment is readily available with a TV featuring satellite channels, and the convenience of a private bathroom equipped with a shower, complimentary toiletries, and a hairdryer adds to the comfort. What's more, every room offers a balcony with views that either gaze upon the sea, the lush garden, or the sparkling pool, allowing guests to wake up to breathtaking scenery every day.

The hotel takes pride in its private beach, which is well-appointed with sun loungers, showers, and parasols for an ultimate beach day experience. The Albanian Star Hotel also knows how to keep its guests entertained, with live music at the Avra Restaurant during the winter and nightly events throughout the high season. For those looking to explore beyond the hotel, car rental, dry cleaning, and laundry services are conveniently available on-site.

For the culturally inclined, the Durrës Castle and the world-renowned Durrës Amphitheatre are both within a mere 5 km distance, offering a peek into the rich history of the area. Transportation is a breeze, with local buses stopping just 150 meters away, and the main train and bus station, as well as the ferry port, are all located 5 km from the hotel.
