The apartment itself is a testament to spacious living, featuring two well-appointed bedrooms, a modern flat-screen TV, and a kitchen equipped with everything needed for a home-cooked meal, including an oven, fridge, washing machine, and stovetop. The provision of towels and bed linen adds a touch of convenience, ensuring a comfortable stay.

For those keen to explore Tirana's cultural scene, Mateo Duplex is ideally situated.

Furthermore, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, just 14 km away, makes Mateo Duplex a compelling choice for both domestic and international travelers looking for a seamless travel experience in Albania.
