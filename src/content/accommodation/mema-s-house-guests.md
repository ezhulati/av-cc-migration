Each air-conditioned unit in this apartment complex is thoughtfully equipped with a fully functional kitchen, empowering guests with the choice to whip up their own meals, adding a touch of home. The inclusion of private bathrooms and complimentary WiFi in every apartment ensures that comfort and connectivity are never compromised.

For those intrigued by history, the proximity to the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha and the Durres Amphitheatre offers a glimpse into Albania's rich past. Moreover, the convenience of being just 36 km away from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport adds to the appeal, making Mema's House a compelling choice for both domestic and international travelers.

In essence, Mema's House not only promises a stay that is comfortable and convenient but also immerses its guests in the vibrant tapestry of Durrës' beaches, history, and culture.
