The highlight, however, is the balcony that offers guests a chance to dine al fresco while soaking in the mesmerizing mountain scenery, all within a soundproof and smoke-free environment.

For those who prefer to stay in, a convenient minimarket on the premises caters to everyday needs. Meanwhile, the adventurous at heart will find the area ideal for cycling and fishing, with bike and car rental services readily available to explore beyond the apartment's confines. The property also features a picnic area and a terrace, perfect for leisurely days under the sun.

Located just 600 meters from Santa Quaranta Beach and a mere 13 kilometers from the lush landscapes of Butrint National Park, White Sea View Residence 2 is an excellent choice for travelers seeking both relaxation and adventure. With Ioannina Airport 97 kilometers away, it serves as a comfortable and accessible retreat for those looking to experience the best of Sarandë.
