The apartment itself is a testament to thoughtful living spaces, featuring a bedroom that promises restful nights, a fully equipped kitchen for those who love to cook, and two bathrooms, adding an extra layer of convenience for families or groups. Entertainment is readily available with the inclusion of a flat-screen TV, ensuring guests have access to their favorite shows and movies after a day of exploration.

Situated just 2.4 km from the historic Independence Square and a mere 2.8 km from the iconic Kuzum Baba, guests at Nona's House are perfectly positioned to dive into the rich cultural tapestry of Vlorë. For those traveling to or from distant locales, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is 151 km away, making Nona's House a strategic choice for both domestic and international travelers looking for a blend of comfort, location, and value in Vlorë.
