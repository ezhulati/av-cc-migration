The apartment itself is a haven of comfort, featuring a balcony that offers serene garden views. It is thoughtfully furnished with a cozy bedroom, a welcoming living room equipped with a flat-screen TV, and a kitchen that boasts modern appliances such as a microwave and a fridge. The inclusion of a bathroom with a walk-in shower, along with the provision of towels and bed linen, ensures a stay that combines convenience with luxury.

For those looking to unwind, the property's garden offers a peaceful retreat. While the allure of the beach is undeniable, guests also find themselves within reach of cultural landmarks, with Skanderbeg Square located 46 km away, and the Rock of Kavaje just 5 km from the doorstep. For international travelers, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is conveniently situated 41 km from 2D Apartment 1 GOLEM, making it an accessible haven for both local and global visitors in search of a tranquil beachside getaway.
