The apartment itself is a testament to spacious living, boasting two well-appointed bedrooms, a cozy living room, and a terrace that offers breathtaking sea views. Entertainment and convenience are at the forefront, with a flat-screen TV and a fully equipped kitchen that includes a dishwasher and an oven. The presence of two bathrooms, each featuring a walk-in shower, adds an extra layer of privacy and comfort. For those who appreciate the finer details, towels and bed linen are thoughtfully provided, enhancing the home-away-from-home experience.

Outdoor dining is elevated to a new level with a dedicated area designed for al fresco meals, allowing guests to savor their dishes against the backdrop of Sarandë's picturesque setting. For explorers eager to traverse the area, a car rental service directly from the apartment simplifies travel plans, making it easy to venture out and discover the region's hidden gems.

Accessibility is also a highlight, with Ioannina Airport located 96 km away, making Appartamento Valentina an accessible retreat for international and domestic travelers alike. This property not only promises a stay filled with comfort and convenience but also serves as a gateway to the enchanting landscapes and rich history of Sarandë.
