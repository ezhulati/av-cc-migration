The bedroom is a cozy retreat, while the living room offers ample space for relaxation. The kitchen is well-appointed with a fridge and stovetop, making it easy for guests to prepare their meals.

For those who enjoy a good drink, the on-site bar serves as a cozy spot to unwind after a day of exploration. While the apartment itself offers a peaceful escape, the surrounding area is ripe for adventure. Skanderbeg Square and the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car are within reachable distances, offering a glimpse into the rich culture and breathtaking landscapes of the region.
