Adding to the charm is a terrace and an outdoor dining area, perfect for meals al fresco while soaking in the peaceful street views. Notably, the apartment maintains a non-smoking and soundproof environment, ensuring a comfortable stay for all guests.

Dining options on-site are plentiful, with a family-friendly restaurant catering to a variety of tastes for dinner, lunch, brunch, and even cocktails.

A garden on the property provides a perfect spot for relaxation.

Situated near popular beaches such as Mali I Robit, Qerret, and Golem Beach, the apartment's location is ideal for beach lovers. For those traveling from afar, the convenience of a paid airport shuttle service to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 42 km away, is an added benefit.
