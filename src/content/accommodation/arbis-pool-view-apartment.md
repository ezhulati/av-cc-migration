The apartment itself is a spacious haven, featuring a well-appointed bedroom, a bathroom complete with essential linens and towels, and a living area that includes a flat-screen TV with satellite channels for entertainment. The dining area, alongside a fully equipped kitchen, allows guests the freedom to prepare and enjoy their meals with a backdrop of serene pool views. Adding to the charm is a terrace and an outdoor dining area, perfect for meals al fresco while soaking in the peaceful street views. Notably, the apartment maintains a non-smoking and soundproof environment, ensuring a comfortable stay for all guests.

Dining options on-site are plentiful, with a family-friendly restaurant catering to a variety of tastes for dinner, lunch, brunch, and even cocktails. For those looking to engage in leisure activities, the apartment offers table tennis, and the surrounding area is renowned for its excellent fishing spots. A garden on the property provides a perfect spot for relaxation.

Situated near popular beaches such as Mali I Robit, Qerret, and Golem Beach, the apartment's location is ideal for beach lovers. For those traveling from afar, the convenience of a paid airport shuttle service to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 42 km away, is an added benefit.

Arbi's Pool View Apartment thus emerges as a top recommendation for those in search of a relaxing getaway with the comforts of home and the added perks of a beachfront location.
