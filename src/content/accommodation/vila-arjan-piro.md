Emphasizing a smoke-free environment, the property promotes a clean and healthy atmosphere for all guests.

The villa itself is a haven of comfort, featuring air conditioning for those warm Mediterranean days. It boasts a spacious bedroom, a fully equipped kitchen for those who love to cook, and a living area complete with a flat-screen TV for entertainment. The highlight, however, is the terrace that opens up to a lush garden view, offering a peaceful spot for morning coffees or evening relaxation.

For those keen on exploring, Vila Arjan Piro serves as an excellent base. It is situated just 18 km from the historical Butrint National Park and 50 km from the ancient ruins of Fanoti, inviting guests to delve into the rich history of the region. Additionally, with Ioannina Airport 94 km away, access to and from the villa is straightforward for international travelers.

Vila Arjan Piro is more than just a place to stay; it's a gateway to experiencing the best of Sarandë's beaches, history, and culture, all while providing a cozy and comfortable home away from home.
