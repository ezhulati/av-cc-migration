Each air-conditioned unit within Pine Apartments is a testament to comfort and convenience, featuring a private bathroom, a flat-screen TV for entertainment, a fully equipped kitchen for those who love to cook, and a balcony to enjoy the serene views. A fridge in every unit adds an extra layer of convenience for guests, ensuring refreshments are always at hand.

For those looking to explore beyond the immediate tranquility, Skanderbeg Square awaits at a distance of 47 km, offering a deep dive into the local culture and history. Meanwhile, the Rock of Kavaje, located just 5.6 km away, presents a unique natural attraction. The nearest gateway, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, is conveniently located 41 km from the apartments, making Pine Apartments an ideal choice for both domestic and international travelers seeking a blend of relaxation and exploration in Golem.
