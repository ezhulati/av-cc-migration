Each apartment is thoughtfully designed with two bedrooms and a living room, providing ample space for guests. The inclusion of a well-equipped kitchen with a minibar adds a touch of home, allowing visitors to prepare their own meals with ease. Entertainment needs are met with a flat-screen TV, ensuring relaxation is always at hand.

For those traveling to or from the area, the convenience of Podgorica Airport being just 58 km away makes Apart Hotel Scutari an ideal location for both short and extended stays. This smoke-free property does not just offer a place to stay but a serene escape in the heart of Shkodër.
