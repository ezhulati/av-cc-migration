Each apartment boasts a balcony that frames the breathtaking mountain scenery, alongside a fully equipped kitchen featuring modern amenities such as a dishwasher and toaster, ensuring a home-away-from-home experience. The inclusion of a private bathroom with a bath adds a touch of luxury, while the convenience of a private entrance underscores the thoughtful design of these family-friendly rooms. Refrigeration needs are seamlessly met with the provision of a fridge in every unit.

For moments of tranquility, guests are invited to unwind in the lush garden, a peaceful retreat from the bustling city life. Adventure seekers will find Butrint National Park, located 17 km away, an enticing destination for day trips and exploration.

Accessibility is further enhanced by the proximity to Ioannina Airport, situated 97 km from the premises, making Alex Apartments a well-positioned haven for both domestic and international travelers.
