Each air-conditioned chalet is a haven of tranquility, offering guests a separate bedroom, a cozy living room, and a bathroom equipped with slippers for that touch of home comfort. The emphasis on privacy is evident, with each unit featuring its own entrance and soundproofing, ensuring a peaceful stay.

Guests have the unique opportunity to immerse themselves in nature without leaving the premises, thanks to the chalet complex's dedicated picnic area. It's the perfect spot for a leisurely day outdoors, surrounded by the stunning landscape for which the region is renowned.

Located 94 km from Podgorica Airport, Bungaja Chalets presents an ideal base for exploring the natural beauty of Shkodër and its surroundings, offering a blend of comfort, convenience, and a connection with nature.
