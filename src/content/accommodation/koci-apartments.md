Each apartment at Koci is thoughtfully designed with comfort in mind, boasting air-conditioning, a private bathroom, a flat-screen TV, and a fully equipped kitchenette. The addition of a terrace or balcony in every unit allows guests to enjoy the serene beauty of Sarandë from the privacy of their accommodation.

For those looking to explore, the historic Butrint National Park is a mere 12 km away, offering a glimpse into the area's rich past, while the ancient ruins of Fanoti are within a 47 km drive, promising an enriching day out. Conveniently located, Ioannina Airport is the nearest gateway, situated 98 km from the apartments, making Koci Apartments an ideal choice for both domestic and international travelers seeking a blend of relaxation and adventure in Sarandë.
