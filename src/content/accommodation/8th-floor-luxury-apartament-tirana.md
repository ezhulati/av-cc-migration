Recently undergoing a comprehensive renovation, this property shines with its commitment to providing a smoke-free environment, ensuring a clean and healthy stay for all guests. The convenience of private parking on-site adds to the seamless experience, catering to those arriving by car.

The apartment itself is a haven of space and light, boasting air-conditioned interiors that are both stylish and functional. Guests will appreciate the thoughtful layout, which includes a well-equipped kitchen featuring a dishwasher and an oven, perfect for those evenings when dining in feels just right. The living area, complete with a flat-screen TV and comfortable seating, invites relaxation after a day of city exploration. The highlight, however, might just be the balcony, offering a private outdoor space to unwind. The bathroom does not disappoint either, with a walk-in shower that adds a touch of luxury to the daily routine.

For those keen to delve into Tirana's rich history and culture, the apartment's location is unbeatable. It's a leisurely stroll away from significant landmarks such as the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, the Postbllok - Checkpoint Monument, and the iconic Pyramid of Tirana. Rinia Park, a nearby oasis of greenery, provides a perfect spot for a leisurely afternoon. Moreover, with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport just 14 km away, arriving and departing could not be more convenient.

8th Floor Luxury Apartment Tirana stands out as a top-tier accommodation choice, offering guests the perfect blend of luxury, location, and convenience. Whether in town for business or leisure, this apartment promises a stay that's as memorable as it is comfortable.
