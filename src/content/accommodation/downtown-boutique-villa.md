Guests are welcomed into a tastefully appointed apartment that boasts a cozy bedroom, a pristine bathroom stocked with fresh linens and towels, and a living area that opens up to a balcony offering serene garden views. The inclusion of a flat-screen TV with cable channels, a dining area, and a fully equipped kitchen ensures a home-away-from-home experience. The highlight of the apartment is its private terrace, where one can unwind and soak in the city's ambiance.

The villa's commitment to a smoke-free environment adds to the comfort of the stay. For those looking to explore beyond the city's charm, Butrint National Park offers a natural escape just 17 km away, while Ioannina Airport is the nearest gateway, located 97 km from the villa.

Downtown Boutique Villa presents an ideal choice for travelers seeking a blend of convenience, comfort, and a touch of luxury in Sarandë.
