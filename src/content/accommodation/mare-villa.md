The apartment is thoughtfully designed with a single bedroom, yet it does not compromise on space or amenities. The kitchen is well-equipped with an oven and a fridge, catering to guests' culinary needs. Entertainment and relaxation are guaranteed with the inclusion of a flat-screen TV and a cozy seating area. The bathroom is modern and accessible, featuring a walk-in shower. For added comfort, guests are provided with towels and bed linen, alongside the thoughtful touch of wine or champagne to elevate the stay.

Located merely 400 meters from Vlore Beach and a short 1.6 km from Ri Beach, Mare Villa offers an ideal base for exploring the local coastline. For those traveling from afar, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is 152 km away, making it a feasible destination for both domestic and international visitors. Mare Villa stands out as a compelling choice for those in pursuit of a memorable stay in Vlorë.
