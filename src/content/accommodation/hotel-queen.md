Accommodations at Hotel Queen are thoughtfully designed for comfort and privacy, featuring en-suite bathrooms equipped with both a bath and a bidet. The added luxuries of bathrobes, slippers, and complimentary toiletries elevate the experience, alongside the entertainment provided by flat-screen TVs with satellite channels in every room.

For those arriving by air, Hotel Queen simplifies travel logistics with a convenient taxi service directly from Tirana Airport to the city center, and subsequently to the hotel's doorstep. The assurance of a 24-hour front desk and the availability of private on-site parking further enhance the guest experience, ensuring peace of mind throughout the stay.

Moreover, the proximity to a bus station, a mere 50m away, opens up Tirana's rich tapestry of culture and history to those who prefer public transport. With Tirana Airport located 17 km from the hotel, Hotel Queen stands as an accessible gateway for both international travelers and those looking to delve into the local scene.
