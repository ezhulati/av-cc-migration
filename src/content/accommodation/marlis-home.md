Following a recent renovation, the villa presents a cozy yet elegant setting with two separate bedrooms, a bathroom, and a living area adorned with a flat-screen TV, perfect for unwinding after a day in the sun. The heart of the home lies in its fully equipped kitchen, complete with a dining area and dishwasher, inviting guests to enjoy home-cooked meals with a view. The addition of outdoor dining options elevates the experience, allowing for memorable meals under the stars.

Privacy and comfort are paramount at Marlis' Home, highlighted by the villa's private entrance and the thoughtful provision of towels and bed linen. Situated a mere 1.2 km from Shkëmbi i Kavajës Beach and within easy reach of Skanderbeg Square, 47 km away, the villa serves as an ideal base for exploring the local area. For those arriving by air, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is conveniently located 41 km from the property, making Marlis' Home an accessible haven for both domestic and international travelers.
