The villa itself is a testament to modern living, featuring two well-appointed bedrooms, a contemporary flat-screen TV, and a fully equipped kitchen that caters to all culinary needs. Additionally, the inclusion of a washing machine and a bathroom complete with a bidet underscores the villa's commitment to providing a home-away-from-home experience. For those cooler evenings, the fireplace offers a cozy ambiance, making it the perfect setting for unwinding after a day of exploration.

Situated a mere 50 km from the iconic Rock of Kavaje and with the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport 85 km away, Vila7 Divjake positions itself as an ideal base for both local sightseeing and further travel adventures. This property stands out for its dedication to a smoke-free environment, ensuring a clean and healthy stay for all guests.
