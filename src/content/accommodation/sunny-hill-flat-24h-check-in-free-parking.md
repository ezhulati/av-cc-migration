This air-conditioned one-bedroom apartment doesn't just promise a place to stay; it offers a home away from home. Guests can enjoy the luxury of a fully equipped kitchen, complete with a dishwasher and oven, ensuring that meals can be as home-cooked or as adventurous as desired. The inclusion of a washing machine adds to the convenience, particularly for longer stays.

The living space extends to a balcony, offering a private outdoor area where guests can unwind. The commitment to a non-smoking environment ensures the freshness and cleanliness of the apartment, enhancing the comfort of the stay.

Connectivity is never an issue, with complimentary WiFi keeping guests in touch with the world or planning their next day's adventures in Tirana. Entertainment needs are met with a flat-screen TV, and the provision of towels and bed linen underscores the attention to detail and guest comfort.

Situated 2.4 km from the historical Former Residence of Enver Hoxha and a mere 2.5 km from the poignant Postbllok - Checkpoint Monument, Sunny Hill Flat positions guests perfectly to explore the rich history and culture of the area. For those looking to venture further, the Rock of Kavaje stands 43 km away, offering a unique day trip opportunity.

The nearest airport, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, is conveniently 14 km away, making Sunny Hill Flat an ideal base for both international travelers and those exploring Albania.
