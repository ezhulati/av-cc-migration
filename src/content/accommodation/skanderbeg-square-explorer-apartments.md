Mornings at Skanderbeg Square EXPLORER APARTMENTS begin with a continental breakfast, setting the tone for a day of exploration or relaxation. For those inclined to venture out, both bicycle and car rental services are readily available, offering a seamless transition from the tranquility of the apartment to the vibrant streets of Tirana.
