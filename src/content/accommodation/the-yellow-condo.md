Boasting a well-appointed bedroom, the condo is equipped with a flat-screen TV offering satellite channels, catering to all entertainment needs. The kitchen doesn't disappoint either, being fully equipped with modern appliances including a dishwasher and an oven, alongside a washing machine for those longer stays. The inclusion of a bathroom with a bidet, along with provided towels and bed linen, adds a touch of home-away-from-home comfort.

Guests can enjoy meals al fresco in the property's outdoor dining area, making the most of Berat's pleasant climate. For those looking to explore beyond the city, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is conveniently located 116 km away, making 'The Yellow' Condo an excellent base for both local and regional adventures.
