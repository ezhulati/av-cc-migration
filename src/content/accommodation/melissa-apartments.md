Each apartment is a haven of relaxation, featuring air-conditioned spaces complemented by a balcony that offers guests a front-row seat to the Adriatic Sea's tranquil beauty. The living areas are thoughtfully designed with a satellite flat-screen TV for entertainment and a seating area for moments of rest. Culinary enthusiasts will appreciate the fully equipped kitchen, complete with an oven, toaster, fridge, stovetop, and essential kitchenware, alongside the convenience of a coffee machine and kettle for morning or evening beverages. The private bathrooms are modern and equipped with walk-in showers and hair dryers, ensuring a comfortable and refreshing stay.

The ancient ruins of Butrint National Park are a mere 13 km away, offering a glimpse into the past, while the enigmatic Ancient Fanoti is within a 47 km drive. Additionally, the proximity to Ioannina Airport, located 97 km away, facilitates easy travel arrangements for international guests.
