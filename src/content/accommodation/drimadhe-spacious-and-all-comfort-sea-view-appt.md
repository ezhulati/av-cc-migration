Guests will find themselves in a beautifully composed living space featuring two cozy bedrooms, a fully equipped kitchen for those homemade meals, and two modern bathrooms. To add to the comfort, the apartment comes with towels and bed linen, ensuring a hassle-free stay.

For those traveling by car, the worry of parking is taken off the list with free private parking available on-site. And while the property maintains a non-smoking policy to ensure the freshness and cleanliness of the apartment, the real gem is the peace and privacy it offers, making it an ideal retreat for families or groups seeking a serene getaway.

Located 161 km from Ioannina Airport, Drimadhë stands as a testament to the beauty and calm of Dhërmi, inviting guests to experience a stay that is as memorable as it is comfortable.
