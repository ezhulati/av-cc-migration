The apartment itself is a haven of comfort, featuring air conditioning for those warm Albanian days. It includes a cozy bedroom, a bathroom equipped with a hair dryer, a welcoming seating area, and a living room designed for relaxation. The balcony, adorned with outdoor furniture, presents an idyllic setting for guests to enjoy the sea's tranquil vistas. For added convenience, the apartment is stocked with essential bed linen, towels, and offers a laundry service.

For those looking to bask in the sun, the sun terrace provides the perfect spot for unwinding.

Situated a brief journey from the Rock of Kavaje, 4.4 km away, and the historical Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, 39 km away, Merry's Apartment positions guests perfectly to explore the rich cultural tapestry of the area. Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is the nearest gateway, located 33 km from the property, making it a convenient choice for travelers seeking both relaxation and adventure in Durrës.
