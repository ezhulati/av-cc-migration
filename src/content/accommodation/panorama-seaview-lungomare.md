The accommodation doesn't just offer a place to rest but an experience, with its terrace providing an ideal spot for soaking in the coastal ambiance. The layout includes a cozy bedroom, a welcoming living room, and a kitchen equipped with everything needed for a home-cooked meal. Entertainment is readily available through the inclusion of a flat-screen TV, making evenings in as appealing as days out exploring.

Situated a mere stone's throw from the heart of Vlorë, guests find themselves conveniently close to Independence Square and the historic Kuzum Baba, with both landmarks less than 3.5 km away. For those venturing from afar, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is the nearest gateway, located 151 km from the doorstep of Panorama Seaview Lungomare.

This apartment not only promises a memorable stay through its facilities and location but also serves as a tranquil retreat from the bustling city life, making it an ideal selection for those looking to immerse themselves in the beauty and calm of Vlorë.
