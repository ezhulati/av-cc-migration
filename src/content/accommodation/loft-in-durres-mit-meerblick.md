The apartment itself is a spacious haven, boasting a well-appointed bedroom, a sleek flat-screen TV, and a kitchen equipped with everything a guest might need - from a dishwasher and oven to a washing machine, toaster, and fridge. The inclusion of towels and bed linen ensures a hassle-free stay, while the private entrance to the accommodation adds an extra layer of privacy for discerning guests.

For those who prefer the convenience of preparing their own meals or need to pick up a quick snack, a minimarket on the premises caters to all basic shopping needs. Additionally, the sun terrace invites guests to unwind and soak up the sun in a tranquil setting.

Beyond the comforts of the apartment, the surrounding area offers plenty to explore. Golem Beach is just a short 1.4 km journey away, promising golden sands and crystal-clear waters, while the historic Skanderbeg Square lies 48 km from the property, offering a glimpse into the rich cultural tapestry of the region. For travelers, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 42 km away, ensures easy access and convenience.

Loft in Durrës mit Meerblick is not just an accommodation; it's a gateway to experiencing the beauty and charm of Durrës, making it an ideal choice for travelers seeking both comfort and adventure.
