The apartment itself boasts a generous layout, featuring two bedrooms that promise restful nights, a living room designed for relaxation, and a balcony that presents captivating city views. The inclusion of a flat-screen TV, an equipped kitchen complete with a dishwasher and an oven, and a bathroom with a walk-in shower, underscores the apartment's commitment to providing a home away from home experience. For added convenience, towels and bed linen are readily available, allowing guests to travel lighter.

Situated 2.7 km from the historical Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, Fit Five also places guests within easy reach of Tirana's cultural heartbeat.

For those arriving by air, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is just 14 km away, making Fit Five an accessible and attractive option for both short and extended stays in Albania's bustling capital.
