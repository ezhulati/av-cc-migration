The guest house's rooms are not only comfortable but also equipped with flat-screen TVs, catering to the entertainment needs of every guest. Mornings at Villa Gjika start with a delightful continental breakfast, with the added charm of a coffee shop on-site for those who appreciate a good brew at any time of the day.

Located a mere 1.6 km from the scenic Borsh Beach and 131 km from Ioannina Airport, Villa Gjika's location makes it an ideal base for exploring the surrounding area. The terrace, offering a space for relaxation and contemplation, further enhances the guest experience, making Villa Gjika a compelling choice for travelers seeking both relaxation and adventure on the Albanian coast.
