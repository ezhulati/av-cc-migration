Each room at Oasis Hostel is thoughtfully equipped with a private bathroom, ensuring privacy and comfort for all guests.

Beyond its doors, the hostel is perfectly positioned for beach enthusiasts; Maracit Beach is merely 1.5 km away, and the picturesque Livadhi Beach can be found at a distance of 2.5 km. For those traveling from afar, Ioannina Airport is the closest air link, located 144 km from the hostel, making it a feasible option for international and domestic travelers alike.
