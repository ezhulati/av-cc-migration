The apartment itself is a spacious retreat, thoughtfully designed with a terrace that invites relaxation and a living room that serves as a cozy haven. The kitchen doesn't disappoint either, being well-appointed with an oven and a fridge to cater to culinary needs. Guests can expect the comfort of towels and bed linen, adding a touch of home. Privacy and security are paramount, with a private entrance for guests and round-the-clock security vigilance.

For those looking to explore beyond the beach, Skanderbeg Square lies 44 km away, offering a dive into the rich local culture, while the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, 48 km from the property, promises an adventure with its breathtaking aerial views. Conveniently, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is the nearest gateway, located 38 km from Fun in the Sun, making arrivals and departures as smooth as the surrounding sands.
