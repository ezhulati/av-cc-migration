The apartment itself is a haven of space and comfort, boasting a bedroom that promises restful nights, a bathroom equipped with essentials, and the added touches of bed linen and towels. The living area is designed for relaxation and entertainment, featuring a flat-screen TV and a dining area that invites guests to enjoy home-cooked meals prepared in the fully equipped kitchen. Perhaps the crown jewel of the apartment is its balcony, offering sweeping sea views that capture the essence of coastal living. Guests can also enjoy serene inner courtyard views, adding to the apartment's tranquil ambiance.

Situated 43 km from the historic Skanderbeg Square and 47 km from the adventure-ready Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, Apartment Sea View serves as an ideal base for exploring the rich cultural tapestry and natural beauty of the area. With Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport just 37 km away, the apartment is conveniently accessible for international travelers seeking the ultimate seaside retreat in Durrës.
