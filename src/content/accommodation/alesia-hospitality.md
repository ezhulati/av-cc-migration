This property distinguishes itself by offering a suite of modern amenities, including complimentary WiFi and a flat-screen TV, ensuring guests stay connected and entertained throughout their visit. The apartment, a smoke-free environment, is thoughtfully designed with an air-conditioned bedroom, a fully equipped kitchen, and a bathroom, providing a home-away-from-home experience.

Cultural enthusiasts will appreciate the apartment's closeness to notable landmarks such as the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, Rinia Park, and the Saint Paul Cathedral, making it effortless to immerse in the local heritage. Additionally, the Postbllok - Checkpoint Monument, Pyramid of Tirana, and Reja - The Cloud are within easy reach, inviting guests to discover the artistic and historical richness of the area.

For those traveling by air, the convenience of being just 15 km away from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport adds to the appeal of Alesia Hospitality, making it an attractive option for both short and extended stays in Tirana.
