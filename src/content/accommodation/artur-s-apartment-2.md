The apartment itself is a study in spacious living, featuring a bedroom that promises restful nights. Entertainment and practicality coalesce in the living space, which is equipped with a flat-screen TV and a kitchen that leaves nothing to be desired. Whether it's whipping up a quick snack or a full meal, the oven, microwave, washing machine, toaster, and fridge ensure that every culinary need is met. The option to dine al fresco in the outdoor dining area, with garden views as a backdrop, elevates the experience.

Beyond the confines of the apartment, guests are invited to bask in the sunshine on the sun terrace or ignite the flavors of vacation with an available barbecue. 

For those looking to explore beyond Gjirokastër, Ioannina Airport is within a manageable distance, making Artur's Apartment 2 an ideal base for both relaxation and adventure in this enchanting part of Albania.
