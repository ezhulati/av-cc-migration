The apartment itself is thoughtfully designed to cater to all your needs, featuring a single, cozy bedroom, a bathroom equipped with modern amenities, and a kitchen that comes fully stocked, ensuring that guests have everything they need at their fingertips. Entertainment is readily available as well, with a flat-screen TV set up for those evenings when staying in feels just right.

Located a considerable distance from the hustle and bustle, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is 120 km away, making Apartament Enxhi a serene retreat that promises a genuine Berat experience without the interference of the city's clamor.
