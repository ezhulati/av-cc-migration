The apartment doesn't skimp on amenities. Guests can expect free WiFi, a flat-screen TV for their entertainment needs, a washing machine for longer stays, and a fully equipped kitchen complete with a fridge, ensuring all the comforts of home. The addition of a private entrance and soundproofing guarantees an undisturbed and personalized stay.

Its proximity to notable attractions such as Skanderbeg Square, the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, and the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet of Albania adds to its appeal, making it an ideal base for exploring Tirana's rich cultural scene. Furthermore, with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport just 14 km away, Soluna Apartment offers a seamless experience for both international and domestic travelers. While private parking is available for an extra charge, the convenience it provides adds to the overall ease of access to this charming city retreat.
