The apartment itself is a spacious haven, boasting a well-appointed bedroom, a cozy living room equipped with a flat-screen TV for entertainment, a fully equipped kitchen for those who love to cook, and a bathroom that offers the choice of a bath or shower. The inclusion of free private parking adds an extra layer of convenience for guests arriving with their vehicles.

For those who prefer to spend their time outdoors, the property features a welcoming garden, perfect for unwinding and soaking in the tranquil atmosphere. Beyond the confines of Lungomare Vlora, guests will find Ri Beach within a 600-meter stroll and the more secluded Vjetër Beach, located 2.7 km away, offering a variety of beach experiences close by.

Accessibility is also a highlight, with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport situated 153 km from the property, making Lungomare Vlora an accessible retreat for both local and international travelers. This property not only promises a memorable stay by the sea but also ensures a peaceful and comfortable retreat from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.
