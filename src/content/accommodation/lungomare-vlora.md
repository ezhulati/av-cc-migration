The apartment itself is a spacious haven, boasting a well-appointed bedroom, a cozy living room equipped with a flat-screen TV for entertainment, a fully equipped kitchen for those who love to cook, and a bathroom that offers the choice of a bath or shower. The inclusion of free private parking adds an extra layer of convenience for guests arriving with their vehicles.

For those who prefer to spend their time outdoors, the property features a welcoming garden, perfect for unwinding and soaking in the tranquil atmosphere.

Accessibility is also a highlight, with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport situated 153 km from the property, making Lungomare Vlora an accessible retreat for both local and international travelers.
