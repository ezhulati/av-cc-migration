The apartment itself is a haven of modern living, featuring air conditioning for those warmer days. It houses a bedroom that promises restful nights, a satellite flat-screen TV for entertainment, a dining area for enjoyable meals, and a fully equipped kitchen with a fridge, making self-catering a breeze. The living room, with its city views, provides a perfect space for relaxation after a day of exploration.

For convenience, a minimarket on the premises means essentials are never far away.

Located a mere 6.9 km from the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, EA-APARTMENT also places guests within easy reach of significant cultural landmarks, including the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, Postbllok - Checkpoint Monument, and the Pyramid of Tirana. For those traveling further afield, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is just 15 km away, making arrivals and departures as smooth as possible.

EA-APARTMENT is not just a place to stay; it's a gateway to experiencing the vibrant culture and history of the city, all while offering the comforts and conveniences of modern living.
