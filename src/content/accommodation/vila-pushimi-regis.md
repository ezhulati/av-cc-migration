The holiday home itself is a testament to comfort and convenience, featuring air conditioning for those warm summer days. It encompasses a separate bedroom, a cozy living room for unwinding, a fully equipped kitchen for culinary adventures, and a bathroom designed with modern amenities. Entertainment needs are well catered to with the inclusion of a flat-screen TV, making it an ideal retreat for both relaxation and leisure.

Adding to the appeal, the property opens up to a balcony that offers a private outdoor space for guests to enjoy the fresh air and perhaps a morning coffee or an evening glass of wine. For travelers flying in, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is located 83 km away, making Vila Pushimi Regis an accessible haven for both local and international visitors seeking a blend of comfort, convenience, and serenity by the Albanian coast.
