With two spacious bedrooms, it comfortably accommodates families or groups looking to explore the beauty of Velipojë and its surroundings.

For those flying in, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is located 84 km away, making Kompleksi Fishta K6 an accessible retreat for both local and international visitors. This property doesn't just promise a stay; it offers an experience that combines the comforts of home with the excitement of travel.
