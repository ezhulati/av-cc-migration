Brightly decorated rooms equipped with air conditioning, LCD satellite TV, and in some cases, a private balcony, provide a comfortable and inviting atmosphere. Each room boasts a well-appointed bathroom complete with a shower and essential amenities, ensuring a pleasant stay.

For those looking to enhance their wellness and fitness during their stay, Te Stela Resort doesn't disappoint. Although some facilities and activities come with an additional fee, the options are vast. Guests can unwind at the outdoor pool, complete with a bar and adjacent restaurant, or opt for the indoor spa center, which offers a range of treatments, two indoor pools, and classes in aerobics and ballroom dancing.

Setting this resort apart is its unique ownership by the Birra Stela beer company, making it a standout destination in Albania. Since its opening in December 2009, the resort has sprawled over 15,000 m², adjacent to the Birra Stela factory. For those interested in the brewing process, guided tours are available, offering an insightful peek into beer production.

Conveniently located just 500 meters from the bustling QTU Shopping Centre, and with local buses to the city center stopping by every half hour, guests can easily explore the area or reach Tiranë's heart within 15 minutes. The resort is also a mere 9 km from Tiranë International Airport, making it an accessible choice for both local and international travelers.

Whether you're in Albania for business or leisure, this resort promises a memorable stay filled with relaxation, discovery, and perhaps, a newfound appreciation for beer.
