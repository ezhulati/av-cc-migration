The apartment itself is a testament to modern living, boasting two well-appointed bedrooms, a cozy living room complete with a flat-screen TV for entertainment, a fully equipped kitchen for those who enjoy preparing their meals, and two bathrooms featuring a bidet and hair dryer for added convenience. The inclusion of a balcony allows guests to enjoy their own private outdoor space, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration.

Cultural enthusiasts will appreciate the proximity to the Durres Amphitheatre, a significant historical site just a few kilometers away. Additionally, the House of Leaves museum, offering insights into the country's past, is also within easy reach. For those traveling by air, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is a mere 34 kilometers away, making 801 Vibes an ideal base for both short and extended stays in Durrës. With its strategic location, comprehensive amenities, and commitment to guest comfort, 801 Vibes promises a memorable stay for all who visit.
