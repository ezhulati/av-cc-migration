The fully equipped kitchen, complete with an oven and toaster, ensures that guests can prepare their meals just the way they like.

The inclusion of a luxurious bathroom, outfitted with a hot tub, elevates the experience, offering a private oasis for rejuvenation.

One of the highlights of Jani's Studio is its delightful balcony, offering views of the lush garden and the quaint inner courtyard. The outdoor dining area adds a touch of charm, allowing guests to enjoy their meals amidst the gentle breeze and the soothing sounds of nature.

For those looking to immerse themselves in the local scenery, the studio's proximity to notable landmarks such as Kuzum Baba and Independence Square provides ample opportunity for cultural exploration.
