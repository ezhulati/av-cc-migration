The apartment itself is a testament to contemporary living, featuring a well-equipped kitchen with a fridge and stovetop, a cozy seating area, and a flat-screen TV for entertainment. The bedroom is a haven of rest and relaxation, complemented by a bathroom that includes a bidet, adding a touch of luxury to the daily routine. The addition of a private entrance enhances the sense of privacy, making guests feel as though they have their own personal retreat in the heart of Vlorë.

Families will appreciate the thoughtful inclusion of a baby safety gate, ensuring the little ones' safety and parents' peace of mind during their stay.

Situated just 2.2 km from the iconic Kuzum Baba and 150 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, ARTEMISA APARTMENTS stands out as a prime choice for both leisure and exploration, promising an accommodation experience that is both comfortable and convenient.
