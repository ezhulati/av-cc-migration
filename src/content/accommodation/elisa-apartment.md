Spanning two bedrooms, the apartment unfolds into a cozy living space adorned with a flat-screen TV, leading into a kitchen that leaves no culinary desire unmet, thanks to its dishwasher and microwave. The inclusion of a bathroom equipped with a hairdryer adds a layer of ease to the living experience.

One of the highlights of Elisa Apartment is undoubtedly its balcony. Offering not just a breath of fresh air but also a feast for the eyes with its mountain and garden views, the balcony, furnished for outdoor relaxation, invites guests to unwind in the embrace of nature.

For those venturing from afar, the proximity to Ioannina Airport, located 82 km away, underscores the apartment's appeal as a gateway to exploring the enchanting surroundings of Gjirokastër.
