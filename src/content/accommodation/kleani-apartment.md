The apartment itself is a study in comfort and privacy, offering guests a cozy one-bedroom sanctuary equipped with all the essentials for a relaxing stay. From the crisp bed linen and fluffy towels to the modern flat-screen TV and a fully equipped kitchen, every detail has been thoughtfully curated to ensure guests feel at home. The dining area provides a perfect spot for a leisurely meal, while the terrace, overlooking the lush garden, invites guests to unwind in the beauty of their surroundings.

Adding to the appeal is the apartment's commitment to a smoke-free environment, ensuring a clean and healthy stay for all guests. The convenience of private parking and the luxury of a private entrance underscore the property's dedication to guest privacy and comfort.

Notably, the apartment's location offers easy access to significant landmarks, including the former Residence of Enver Hoxha and the Durres Amphitheatre, both within a 40 km radius. For those arriving by air, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is a mere 34 km away, making KleaNì Apartment a convenient choice for both domestic and international travelers seeking a peaceful haven in the heart of Durrës.
