The apartment itself is a testament to modern living, featuring air conditioning for those warm Tirana days, a satellite flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a dining area perfect for a cozy meal. The kitchen is fully equipped, boasting an oven among other essentials, making it ideal for those who prefer to prepare their own meals. A comfortable living room, along with provided towels and bed linen, adds to the homely feel of the accommodation, which strictly adheres to a non-smoking policy.

For those looking to explore, the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car is located 7.4 km away, offering an adventure into the scenic heights of the area. Meanwhile, the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha is just a stone's throw away at 3.7 km, presenting an opportunity to delve into the local history. Conveniently, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is the nearest airport, situated 11 km from the property, and both airport transfers and car rental services are readily available, making Kalpazo Home Tirana Aviation an excellent base for both leisure and exploration in Tirana.
