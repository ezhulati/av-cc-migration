The property features a generously sized apartment, thoughtfully designed with two bedrooms and a bathroom, ensuring ample space for guests. Comfort is prioritized with the provision of quality bed linen and towels, while entertainment needs are met with a flat-screen TV equipped with satellite channels. The dining area serves as a cozy spot for meals, and the fully equipped kitchen allows guests the freedom to prepare their own culinary delights. Perhaps the highlight of the apartment is the terrace, offering breathtaking sea views, complemented by an outdoor dining area where guests can dine al fresco against a backdrop of mountain scenery. It's important to note that the accommodation maintains a non-smoking policy, ensuring a clean and fresh environment for all guests.

An on-site bar adds to the convenience, providing a relaxed setting for guests to unwind with a drink. For those eager to explore the surroundings, West End Beach is within easy reach, located less than 1 km away. Further afield, Skanderbeg Square offers a glimpse into the local culture and history, situated 41 km from the property. For travelers, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, just 35 km away, makes Sunset Vibes Durrës an ideal choice for both short and extended stays, promising a blend of comfort, convenience, and scenic beauty.
