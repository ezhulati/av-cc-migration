Each apartment boasts a garden-view balcony, creating the perfect backdrop for morning coffees or evening relaxation. The interiors are thoughtfully designed with a cozy seating area, complemented by a satellite LCD TV for entertainment. Privacy and comfort are paramount, with every room featuring its own bathroom equipped with a shower. For those looking to make the most of the beach, towels are available for rent, adding an extra layer of convenience to your stay.

Beyond the comforts of Villa Paja, the allure of Ksamil continues with the proximity to Butrint National Park. A short drive away, guests can explore the ancient city of Butrint, a treasure trove of archaeological wonders located just 5 km from the villa. Villa Paja not only promises a serene retreat but also an opportunity to immerse oneself in the rich tapestry of history and natural beauty that surrounds it.
