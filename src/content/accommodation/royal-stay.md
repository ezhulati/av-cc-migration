Guests are welcomed into a generously sized apartment, thoughtfully designed to include two bedrooms, a cozy living room, a kitchen equipped with everything needed for a home-cooked meal, and a well-appointed bathroom. Entertainment needs are catered to with a flat-screen TV, ensuring relaxation and leisure are always within reach.

Situated a mere 2.6 km from the serene Vjetër Beach, Royal Stay also offers easy access to local landmarks such as Kuzum Baba and Independence Square, located 3.1 km and 3.3 km away, respectively. For those venturing from afar, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is 153 km from the property, making Royal Stay an accessible retreat for both local and international visitors.

In essence, Royal Stay is not just a place to stay; it's a gateway to exploring the vibrant city of Vlorë, promising a blend of comfort, convenience, and memorable experiences for all who visit.
