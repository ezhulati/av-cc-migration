The complex is not just about its prime location; it's a haven of comfort and accessibility. Each apartment is a blend of functionality and style, equipped with air conditioning, a flat-screen TV with cable channels, a fully furnished kitchen, and a dining area. Safety is prioritized with a deposit box and private bathrooms that come with a bidet, slippers, and a hairdryer, ensuring a worry-free stay. The cherry on top is the balcony that opens up to captivating city views, a feature available in all units, alongside the convenience of a dishwasher.

For families, the children's playground becomes a delightful escape for the little ones, while the on-site bar serves as a perfect spot for adults to unwind. The property stands out for its inclusivity, offering facilities for disabled guests, free WiFi, and private parking at no extra cost.

Mobility is made easy with a car rental service available directly from the apartment, inviting guests to explore the surrounding attractions such as the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, 6.5 km away, and the historical Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, just 3.6 km from the doorstep. For those traveling further, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is 12 km away, with the apartment offering a paid shuttle service for a seamless travel experience.

Tirana Primo Apartment is more than just a place to stay; it's a gateway to experiencing the vibrant culture and history of Tirana, all while offering the comforts and conveniences of modern living.
