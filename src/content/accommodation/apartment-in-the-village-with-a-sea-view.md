The interiors are equally impressive, featuring a cozy seating area, a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a fully equipped kitchen that includes a dishwasher and an oven, catering to all culinary needs. The convenience of a private bathroom with a walk-in shower, coupled with the provision of fresh bed linen and towels, adds to the overall experience of a home away from home.

Moreover, every unit boasts a patio adorned with outdoor furniture, where guests can soak in the mountain views, adding another layer of tranquility to their stay. For those little necessities or quick snacks, the on-site minimarket proves incredibly handy.

Whether it's the allure of the beach or the charm of the city, this accommodation offers a blend of convenience, comfort, and breathtaking views, making it a top pick for discerning travelers.
