Guests can enjoy the modern comforts of home, thanks to the apartment's free WiFi, flat-screen TV, washing machine, and a kitchen that leaves nothing to be desired with its dishwasher and oven. The added benefit of a private entrance and round-the-clock security ensures a stay that is both secluded and safe.

For those looking to explore the area at their own pace, a car rental service directly from the apartment makes discovering the local sights and sounds both easy and convenient. Daniel's House is ideally located, with Shkëmbi i Kavajës Beach just 500 meters away, and the serene Golem Beach within a short 2.8 km distance. For international travelers, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is a manageable 35 km from the property, making Daniel's House an excellent hub for both local and foreign visitors to Durrës.
