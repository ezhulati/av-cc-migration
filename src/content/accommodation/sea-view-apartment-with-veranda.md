The living space is enhanced by a flat-screen TV with cable channels, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration. The heart of the apartment, a fully equipped kitchen, comes stocked with modern appliances such as a dishwasher, oven, washing machine, microwave, and fridge, catering to all culinary needs.

One of the apartment's highlights is its veranda, offering panoramic views of the surrounding mountains. Furnished for comfort, it invites guests to relax and enjoy the scenic city vistas. For those looking to explore the local area, the apartment's location does not disappoint. The historic Kuzum Baba is a short 6.9 km drive away, while Independence Square is just a bit further at 7.1 km, offering a glimpse into the rich culture and history of Vlorë.

For beach enthusiasts, the proximity to the Beach at Government Villas, less than 1 km away, and Coco Bongo Beach, 2 km from the property, means a variety of coastal experiences are within easy reach. Despite its serene location, the apartment remains well-connected, with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport 156 km away, making it a convenient option for international travelers.

Sea View Apartment with Veranda thus emerges as a top recommendation for those looking to experience the best of Vlorë, combining the comforts of home with the beauty of the Albanian coast.
