The accommodation itself is thoughtfully designed, featuring a bedroom that promises restful nights, a fully equipped kitchen for those who enjoy crafting their meals, and a modern bathroom. Entertainment needs are also well catered for with the inclusion of a flat-screen TV, ensuring guests have access to their favorite shows and movies after a day of exploration.

For those traveling to the area via air, the convenience of being 150 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport adds to the appeal, making Plazhi i Vjeter a compelling choice for both short and extended stays in Vlorë.
