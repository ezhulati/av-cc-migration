Designed with families in mind, the property boasts a children's playground, ensuring that younger guests are entertained, while on-site parking adds an extra layer of convenience for those arriving by car.

The apartment itself is a testament to modern living, featuring a spacious living room equipped with a flat-screen TV, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration. The fully equipped kitchen, complete with a fridge, invites guests to prepare their meals, offering a taste of home away from home in a non-smoking environment.

For those who relish a good cup of coffee, the on-site coffee shop serves as a cozy spot to start the day or recharge in the afternoon.

Location is key, and Duka's Home doesn't disappoint. Situated just 3.1 km from the iconic Skanderbeg Square and 7 km from the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, guests are perfectly positioned to explore the best of Tirana. Moreover, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, only 12 km away, makes arrivals and departures a breeze.
