Each room at Hotel Portanova is thoughtfully equipped with a desk and a flat-screen TV, catering to the needs of both leisure and business travelers. The inclusion of a safety deposit box in every room adds an extra layer of security for guests' valuables. Select accommodations elevate the experience further, featuring balconies that offer sweeping views of the sea, allowing guests to soak in the breathtaking scenery from the comfort of their rooms. The attention to detail is evident in the provision of quality bed linen and towels, ensuring a comfortable and hassle-free stay.

The hotel prides itself on its exceptional service, with a dedicated staff available around the clock at the reception to assist guests with any needs or inquiries. This commitment to guest satisfaction makes Hotel Portanova a standout choice for visitors to the area.

Strategically positioned, Hotel Portanova is a stone's throw away from popular attractions such as Sarande Main Beach, Saranda Bay Beach, and Saranda City Beach, making it an ideal base for exploring the natural beauty and vibrant culture of the region. For those traveling from afar, Ioannina Airport is located 98 km away, with the hotel offering paid airport shuttle services for a seamless travel experience.
