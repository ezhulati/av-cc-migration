The inclusion of bed linen, towels, a flat-screen TV equipped with streaming services, and a fully equipped kitchen ensures a stay that lacks for nothing. Perhaps most enticing is the balcony, offering serene garden views-a rare find in the bustling city center. The option to dine al fresco adds a touch of luxury, allowing guests to savor their meals against the backdrop of Tirana's cityscape, all from the comfort of their private outdoor dining area. It's worth noting that the apartment is both non-smoking and soundproof, ensuring a peaceful retreat from the urban buzz.

For dining options, the property doesn't disappoint. The on-site restaurant caters to a variety of tastes and is particularly welcoming to families. Open for both lunch and dinner, it provides a convenient and delightful dining experience without the need to venture far.

Mobility is made easy with both bicycle and car rental services available directly from the apartment, encouraging guests to explore Tirana's rich tapestry of attractions at their own pace. Notable nearby landmarks include the Toptani Shopping Centre, the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet of Albania, and the National Gallery of Arts Tirana, each offering a unique glimpse into the city's cultural and artistic heritage.

For those coming from afar, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is located 14 km away, with the apartment offering a paid shuttle service for a seamless arrival and departure experience.

In summary, Centerbestview of Tirana stands out as a sophisticated haven for travelers who value the blend of prime location, comprehensive amenities, and the promise of an unforgettable stay in Albania's captivating capital.
