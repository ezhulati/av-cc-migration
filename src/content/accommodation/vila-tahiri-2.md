The apartment itself is generously sized, featuring two well-appointed bedrooms, a cozy living room, a bathroom, and a kitchen equipped with everything needed for a self-sufficient stay. Guests can enjoy their favorite shows on the flat-screen TV while taking in the tranquil garden views that the property affords.

For those looking to explore beyond the immediate area, Vila Tahiri 2 serves as an excellent base, with Skanderbeg Square located 46 km away, and the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car offering scenic rides 50 km from the apartment. Additionally, the convenience of being 40 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport makes it a compelling choice for both domestic and international travelers.

In summary, Vila Tahiri 2 stands out as a welcoming haven for guests who value both the peace of a seaside getaway and the accessibility to local attractions.
