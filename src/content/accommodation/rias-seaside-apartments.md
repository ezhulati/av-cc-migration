The apartments themselves are a haven of comfort, featuring air conditioning, cozy seating areas, and flat-screen TVs with satellite channels for a touch of home. The inclusion of a fully equipped kitchen and dining area in each unit allows guests the freedom to craft their meals, while the safety deposit box, private bathroom complete with a bidet, slippers, and hair dryer, ensure both security and comfort. Select units boast the added luxury of a terrace or balcony, offering breathtaking sea views that promise to enchant.

Families traveling with little ones will appreciate the thoughtful addition of a baby safety gate, ensuring peace of mind during their stay. The on-site snack bar serves as a convenient spot for light refreshments, allowing more time to be spent soaking in the sun and less worrying about meal preparations.

Situated a mere 1.9 km from Ri Beach and 2.5 km from Independence Square, Rias Seaside Apartments offers an ideal base for exploring the rich cultural tapestry and natural beauty of Vlorë. With Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport 151 km away, the journey to this serene escape is well worth the distance, promising an unforgettable stay marked by comfort, convenience, and the warmth of Albanian hospitality.
