The hostel distinguishes itself with a welcoming shared lounge, perfect for guests to relax and mingle after a day of sightseeing. The commitment to guest satisfaction is evident through the provision of a 24-hour front desk, efficient airport transfer services, a communal kitchen for those who enjoy preparing their meals, and the essential convenience of complimentary WiFi throughout the property.

Accommodations at Hostel Split Rock are thoughtfully designed with guest comfort in mind. Each room is a haven of rest, equipped with air conditioning for those warm Tirana days, a wardrobe for personal belongings, and a flat-screen TV for entertainment. Select rooms boast the added luxury of a balcony, offering a private outdoor space to unwind. The inclusion of bed linen in every room ensures a restful night's sleep.

For those eager to delve into the local culture, the hostel is a stone's throw away from Rinia Park, the Clock Tower of Tirana, and the Et'hem Bey Mosque, making it an ideal base for exploring the city's architectural marvels and green spaces. With Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport just 14 km away, Hostel Split Rock offers both convenience and comfort for travelers looking to experience the vibrant life of Tirana.
