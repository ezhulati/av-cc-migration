This apartment doesn't just offer a place to stay; it provides a spacious, air-conditioned haven complete with a welcoming balcony and the essential modern amenity of free WiFi. The non-smoking environment ensures a clean and healthy stay for all guests.

Accommodation here is thoughtfully designed with a single bedroom, but it's the attention to detail that impresses. A fully equipped kitchen allows for the easy preparation of meals, adding a touch of home, while the inclusion of a flat-screen TV caters to entertainment needs.

For those looking to venture further, Kuzum Baba is located just 3 kilometers away, offering a glimpse into the local heritage. Moreover, the property's proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, 150 kilometers away, facilitates ease of travel for international guests.

Endri's Apartment thus emerges as a compelling choice for those desiring a blend of leisure and exploration in Vlorë.
