The holiday home itself is a spacious retreat, featuring two well-appointed bedrooms, a living area designed for comfort, and a terrace that invites guests to soak in the stunning sea views. The inclusion of a fully equipped kitchen, complete with a dishwasher and an oven, allows for a home-cooked meal away from home, while the convenience of two bathrooms, each with a bath and a hairdryer, adds an extra layer of comfort. Air conditioning, a washing machine, and a dedicated seating area further enhance the living experience, making Vila A an ideal choice for families or groups.

Security is a priority, with the property ensuring guest safety through full-day security and a private entrance. For those traveling with little ones, the availability of outdoor play equipment is a thoughtful touch, promising fun-filled moments for the younger guests.

While the allure of Vila A might make it tempting to stay in, the property's proximity to Nazar Beach, just over a kilometer away, encourages exploration. For added convenience, a minimarket on-site ensures that essentials are always within reach.

For guests looking to explore beyond Himare, the property offers a paid airport shuttle service to Ioannina Airport, located 168 km away, making arrivals and departures as smooth as possible.

In summary, Vila A stands out as a meticulously designed holiday home that promises both the tranquility of a beachfront location and the comforts of modern living, making it a compelling choice for those looking to escape to the Albanian coast.
