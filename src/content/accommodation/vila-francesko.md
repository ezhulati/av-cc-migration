Perfectly positioned, Vila Françesko is a mere 500 meters from the vibrant Ksamil Beach 9, closely followed by the tranquil Bora Bora Beach at 600 meters, and a short drive of 2.7 km brings guests to the historic Butrint National Park.

With the convenience of a 24-hour front desk and the entire property blanketed in free WiFi, guests are assured a stay that combines comfort and connectivity.

For those traveling from afar, Corfu International Airport is located 92 km away, making Vila Françesko an accessible retreat for international visitors seeking a blend of beachside bliss and cultural exploration.
