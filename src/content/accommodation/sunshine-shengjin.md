The apartment itself is a study in spacious, airy living, featuring a balcony that presents unobstructed sea views. Designed to accommodate with ease, it includes a bedroom, a living area equipped with a flat-screen TV, and a kitchen outfitted with modern appliances including a dishwasher and an oven. The inclusion of a bathroom with a shower, along with the provision of towels and bed linen, underscores the property's commitment to comfort.

For those looking to unwind without straying far, the in-house bar serves as a cozy retreat. Additionally, the convenience of an on-site minimarket caters to any last-minute needs or cravings.

Located 43 km from Lake Skadar and 48 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, Sunshine Shengjin positions itself as not just a stay, but a gateway to the rich cultural and natural tapestry of the region.
