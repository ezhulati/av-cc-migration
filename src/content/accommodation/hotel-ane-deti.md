Each room, designed with the modern traveler in mind, comes equipped with a flat-screen TV, a balcony for those units with sea vistas, and a fridge, ensuring both convenience and comfort during your stay.

Situated just 300 meters from the inviting sands of Golem Beach and a short 2.4 km journey from the picturesque Shkëmbi i Kavajës Beach, Hotel Ane Deti positions itself as an ideal base for beach enthusiasts. Moreover, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 40 km away, adds to the appeal for international travelers seeking a seamless experience.

Beyond the rooms, guests can unwind in the tranquil garden or enjoy a refreshing drink at the bar, making Hotel Ane Deti not just a place to stay, but a memorable part of their travel experience.
