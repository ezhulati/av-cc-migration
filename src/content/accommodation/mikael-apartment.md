Guests are welcomed into a spacious, air-conditioned haven featuring two well-appointed bedrooms, a fully equipped kitchen complete with an oven and microwave, and a cozy seating area perfect for unwinding. The highlight is undoubtedly the balcony, offering an outdoor dining space where visitors can savor meals against the backdrop of breathtaking sea views.

The apartment ensures convenience at every turn, boasting amenities such as a lift for easy access, a terrace for soaking up the sun, and complimentary WiFi to keep guests connected. The commitment to a smoke-free environment further enhances the comfort of your stay.

For those needing essentials or a quick snack, a minimarket on the premises caters to your needs without having to leave the comfort of the apartment. Additionally, a shared lounge area invites guests to relax and socialize, adding to the communal feel of the accommodation.

Situated just 7 km from the intriguing Rock of Kavaje and 38 km from the historical Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, Mikael Apartment is not only a retreat but a gateway to exploring the rich culture and history of the area. With the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport only 32 km away, and the convenience of a paid airport shuttle service, arriving and departing is a breeze, making it an excellent choice for both leisure and business travelers looking for a seamless and enjoyable stay in Durrës.
