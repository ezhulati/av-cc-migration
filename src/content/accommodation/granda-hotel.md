Each room is thoughtfully furnished, featuring a wardrobe, a flat-screen TV, and, for select accommodations, a balcony to enjoy the city's ambiance. A fridge in every room adds an extra layer of convenience for guests, making it easy to store snacks and beverages.

Beyond the comforts of the rooms, Granda Hotel stands out for its commitment to service. The availability of room service, a 24-hour front desk, and currency exchange facilities speaks volumes of its dedication to guest satisfaction.

For those looking to explore, the hotel's proximity to notable attractions adds to its appeal. The Dajti Ekspres Cable Car is within a short drive, offering breathtaking views of the area, while the historical Former Residence of Enver Hoxha is also nearby. Moreover, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is just 12 km away, making arrivals and departures as smooth as possible.

Granda Hotel, with its strategic location and comprehensive amenities, positions itself as an ideal base for both leisure and business travelers in Tirana.
