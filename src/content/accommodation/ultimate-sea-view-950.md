This property doesn't just offer a place to stay; it provides a home away from home. The apartment boasts a generous layout that includes a bedroom, a living room with a flat-screen TV, a fully equipped kitchen, and a bathroom with a shower. The highlight, however, is the balcony that offers unobstructed sea views, promising guests a tranquil retreat where they can unwind to the sound of the waves.

Ultimate Sea View 950 is distinguished by its commitment to guest convenience, offering private check-in and check-out, a minimarket for essentials, and complimentary WiFi across the premises. For those concerned about health and safety, it's reassuring to know the property maintains a strict non-smoking policy.

For guests looking to explore beyond the beach, the property is within a reasonable distance from Skanderbeg Square and the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, offering a glimpse into the rich culture and natural beauty of the area. Additionally, with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport just 36 km away, and a paid airport shuttle service available, arriving and departing could not be more hassle-free.

Ultimate Sea View 950 is more than just an accommodation; it's a gateway to a memorable coastal experience in Durrës, combining the comforts of home with the beauty of the Albanian seaside.
