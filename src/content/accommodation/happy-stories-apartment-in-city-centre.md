The apartment itself is a haven of space and light, featuring a bedroom, a bathroom, and a living area that includes a dining space and a fully equipped kitchen. The inclusion of bed linen, towels, a flat-screen TV with streaming services, and a balcony offering breathtaking mountain views adds to the comfort of the stay. The private entrance ensures guests' privacy is paramount, making it an ideal retreat for those looking to unwind in peace.

For those who appreciate the little conveniences, the presence of a coffee shop and a minimarket on the premises is a welcome addition. Furthermore, the property's proximity to Podgorica Airport, located 58 km away, is mitigated by the availability of a paid airport shuttle service, ensuring smooth transitions to and from the accommodation.

Happy Stories' Apartment in City Centre stands out as a meticulously designed space that caters to the needs of modern travelers, making it a compelling choice for those visiting Shkodër.
