The apartment itself is a haven of modern comfort, featuring air conditioning for those warm summer days, a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a dining area for intimate meals. The fully equipped kitchen, complete with a fridge, invites guests to prepare their own seaside feasts, while the cozy living room provides a perfect setting for relaxation after a day of sun and surf. The emphasis on a smoke-free environment ensures a fresh and inviting atmosphere throughout the stay.

For those looking to explore beyond the beach, Skanderbeg Square offers a cultural excursion just 46 km away, while the convenience of Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 41 km from the property, facilitates easy travel arrangements. Pool View Apartment stands out as an idyllic escape for those seeking the comfort of a beachfront location combined with the privacy and amenities of a fully equipped apartment.
