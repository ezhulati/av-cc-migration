For those looking to explore, the historic Independence Square is merely 1.7 km away, while the enchanting Ri Beach awaits at a distance of 2.7 km. The cultural landmark of Kuzum Baba is also within easy reach, located just 2.2 km from the doorstep.

For travelers venturing from afar, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is the nearest gateway, situated 150 km from the Lovely Seaview Apartment, making it a convenient option for international visitors.

In essence, the Lovely Seaview Apartment emerges as a distinguished choice for those desiring a blend of scenic views, strategic location, and the warmth of a well-appointed home away from home in Vlorë.
