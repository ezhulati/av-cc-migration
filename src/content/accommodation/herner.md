Each room at HERNER is a testament to modern luxury, featuring air conditioning for those warm Vlorë days, a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a private bathroom equipped with a bidet and plush bathrobes. The convenience of in-room amenities such as a fridge, kitchenware, and a kettle enhances the stay, ensuring guests feel right at home. Moreover, the provision of bed linen and towels in each unit adds a touch of thoughtful hospitality.

The guest house's garden offers a peaceful haven for relaxation, inviting guests to unwind amidst nature's embrace.

Strategically located, HERNER is just a short distance from the city's must-visit sites. Vjetër Beach is merely 2.9 km away, offering a perfect escape to the sea, while Independence Square is even closer, at 2 km, allowing guests to immerse themselves in the local culture and history. For those traveling from afar, the convenience of being 148 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport makes HERNER an ideal choice for both domestic and international travelers seeking a memorable stay in Vlorë.
