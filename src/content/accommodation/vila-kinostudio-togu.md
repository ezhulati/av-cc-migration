The apartment itself is a testament to spacious living, featuring two well-appointed bedrooms that cater to relaxation and privacy. The kitchen is a culinary enthusiast's dream, fully equipped with a dishwasher and an oven, ensuring that meals can be as home-cooked or as adventurous as desired. The inclusion of a bathroom complete with a bidet, bathrobes, and a washing machine adds a layer of convenience, while the thoughtful touch of chocolates or cookies in-room elevates the experience from a mere stay to a memorable retreat.

Entertainment needs are well catered to with a flat-screen TV, ensuring that guests have access to leisure at their fingertips. Vila Kinostudio (Togu) is not just about the amenities within but also benefits from its proximity to notable landmarks. Skanderbeg Square, a hub of cultural and historical significance, is located just 4.9 km away, while the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha is a mere 5.1 km from the apartment, offering a glimpse into the country's past.

For those traveling by air, the convenience is further amplified with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport situated only 16 km away, making Vila Kinostudio (Togu) an ideal base for exploring Tirana's rich tapestry of experiences. This apartment stands out as a beacon of comfort and convenience, promising an unforgettable stay for all who visit.
