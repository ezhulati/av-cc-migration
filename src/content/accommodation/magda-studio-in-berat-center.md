The layout of Magda Studio is thoughtfully designed to cater to the needs of modern travelers. It boasts a well-equipped kitchen, complete with an oven and toaster for those moments when dining in feels just right. The living space is anchored by a flat-screen TV and a cozy seating area, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration. The presence of a meticulously maintained bathroom, equipped with a shower, alongside the provision of fresh towels and bed linen, underscores the apartment's attention to detail.

Privacy is paramount at Magda Studio, with a private entrance ensuring a sense of seclusion amidst the buzz of Berat. For guests venturing from afar, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 117 km away, makes this apartment a convenient base for both short and extended stays in the region.
