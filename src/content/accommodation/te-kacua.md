Upon entering the apartment, guests are greeted with a tastefully furnished space that includes a cozy bedroom, a modern bathroom, a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a dining area ideal for enjoying home-cooked meals prepared in the fully equipped kitchen. The highlight, however, is the terrace that presents breathtaking mountain views, offering a perfect backdrop for morning coffees or evening relaxation.

For those keen to explore, Te Kacua serves as an excellent base. The vibrant Independence Square is just 6.6 km away, while the picturesque Ri Beach and the historic Kuzum Baba are within easy reach. For international travelers, the convenience of being 156 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport adds to the appeal of this property.

With its blend of comfort, convenience, and captivating views, Te Kacua stands out as a top choice for travelers seeking a memorable stay in Vlorë.
