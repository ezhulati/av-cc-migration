The guesthouse prides itself on providing accommodations that cater to families, featuring rooms with stunning views of the surrounding mountains and lush gardens. The presence of a garden and city vistas from the property adds a tranquil backdrop to an already serene stay. For those who value connectivity, complimentary WiFi is available throughout the premises, ensuring guests stay connected with the world or plan their next day's adventures in Tirana.

Accommodations at Albjona Guesthouse 1 are thoughtfully designed with guest comfort in mind, offering shared bathroom facilities and, in select rooms, the luxury of a private terrace. The option of soundproof rooms underscores the guesthouse's commitment to ensuring a restful night's sleep, free from the hustle and bustle of the city outside.

Strategically located, the guesthouse is a stone's throw away from several of Tirana's must-visit landmarks, including the National Museum of History Albania, the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet of Albania, and the House of Leaves. For guests arriving by air, the convenience of being just 13 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport makes Albjona Guesthouse 1 an excellent choice for both short visits and extended stays in Albania's vibrant capital.
