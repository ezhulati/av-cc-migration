The apartment itself is a testament to thoughtful accommodation, boasting a spacious layout that includes a well-equipped kitchen, a cozy bedroom, and a living area designed for relaxation. The inclusion of modern amenities such as air conditioning, free WiFi, and a flat-screen TV ensures that guests experience the comforts of home while enjoying their getaway. The balcony, offering views of the sea and surrounding gardens, provides a serene backdrop for morning coffees or evening reflections.

Attention to detail is evident in the provision of quality towels and bed linen, enhancing the overall stay experience. Additionally, the apartment's commitment to privacy and tranquility is underscored by soundproofing and a private entrance, ensuring a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of daily life.

For those looking to explore beyond the beach, Butrint National Park lies 15 km away, offering a glimpse into the area's rich history and natural beauty. Although the nearest airport, Ioannina Airport, is 96 km from the apartment, the journey is well worth the destination for those in search of a memorable Sarandë experience.
