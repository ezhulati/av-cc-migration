Each room at Hotel Piazza is thoughtfully equipped with air conditioning, ensuring a comfortable stay regardless of the weather. The inclusion of a desk and a balcony with a city view caters to both business travelers and leisure seekers alike. The convenience of a private bathroom, coupled with the provision of a flat-screen TV, bed linen, and towels, underscores the hotel's commitment to guest comfort. For those who prefer the flexibility of preparing their own meals, select rooms boast a kitchen complete with an oven and a stovetop, not to mention a fridge for keeping beverages and snacks chilled.

Situated 96 kilometers from Ioannina Airport, Hotel Piazza represents an ideal base for exploring the vibrant city of Sarandë and its picturesque surroundings. Whether it's the allure of the nearby beaches or the call of the ancient Butrint National Park, guests are perfectly positioned to experience the best the area has to offer.
