Perhaps the most captivating feature is the balcony, offering breathtaking sea views - an ideal backdrop for meals in the outdoor dining area.

Situated just 41 km from the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car and within easy reach of the Rock of Kavaje, the apartment serves as a perfect base for exploring the local area. Moreover, the historical significance of the region is highlighted by its proximity to the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, located 37 km away.

For those arriving by air, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is conveniently 31 km from the property, with a paid airport shuttle service available to ensure a smooth transition to this coastal retreat.
