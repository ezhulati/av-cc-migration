The apartment itself is a testament to spacious living, featuring a balcony that presents breathtaking sea views. It is well-appointed with a bedroom, a cozy living room, a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a kitchen equipped with essentials including a toaster and a fridge. The convenience of a walk-in shower in the bathroom, along with the provision of towels and bed linen, adds to the comfort of the stay. Notably, the accommodation ensures guest privacy with a separate entrance.

For those who might need to pick up essentials or snacks, a minimarket on the property caters to those needs. Sunny View Apt is not just about the stay; it's about the experience. Guests have the opportunity to engage in local activities, with fishing being a popular choice among visitors.

The apartment's location is ideal for beach enthusiasts, with Flamingo Beach merely 500 meters away and Santa Quaranta Beach within a 1.1 km distance. For guests arriving from afar, the nearest airport is in Ioannina, 98 km away, and for added convenience, Sunny View Apt offers a paid airport shuttle service.

In summary, Sunny View Apt is a stellar accommodation choice for those looking to explore Sarandë, offering a blend of comfort, convenience, and the promise of memorable experiences.
