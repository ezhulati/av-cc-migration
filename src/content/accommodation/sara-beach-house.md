Guests are welcomed into a generously sized apartment, thoughtfully designed with three bedrooms and two bathrooms to accommodate both families and groups. The inclusion of luxurious bed linen, towels, and a flat-screen TV with satellite channels in the living space guarantees a stay that marries relaxation with entertainment. The heart of the apartment, a fully equipped kitchen alongside a dedicated dining area, invites guests to craft and enjoy meals with a backdrop of the sea. The terrace, offering breathtaking sea views, becomes a private oasis where moments can be savored over wine, champagne, or fruits, provided for an elevated experience.

The convenience on-site extends to an outdoor dining area for those who prefer al fresco meals and a minimarket, ensuring essentials are always within reach. For explorers eager to immerse in local culture and scenery, Coco Bongo Beach and the historic Kuzum Baba are within easy reach, located 1.8 km and 7 km away, respectively.

Positioned 156 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, Sara Beach House simplifies travel arrangements with an optional paid airport shuttle service, making it an accessible retreat for international and domestic travelers alike. This property stands out as a beacon of comfort and convenience, promising an unforgettable stay in the heart of Vlorë.
