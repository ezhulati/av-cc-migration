Each room at Hotel Continental is a haven of relaxation, boasting air conditioning for those warm Mediterranean days and a flat-screen TV for entertainment at any hour. The inclusion of a private bathroom, complete with either a bath or shower and a bidet, adds a touch of convenience, while the balcony present in every unit invites guests to enjoy their own slice of tranquility. For those seeking extra comfort, select rooms offer a sofa, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration.

Beyond the confines of its rooms, Hotel Continental caters to leisure and convenience alike. Guests can enjoy a friendly game of billiards, an ideal way to relax and socialize within the hotel's premises. Moreover, the assurance of a 24-hour front desk means that assistance is always readily available, ensuring a worry-free stay.

Located 39 km from Tirana and a mere 36 km from Tirana Airport, Hotel Continental stands as a gateway for international travelers and those looking to delve into the heart of Albania. Whether it's the allure of Durrës's ancient sites or the modern convenience of on-site amenities, Hotel Continental offers a compelling blend of both, making it a standout choice for discerning guests.
