The apartment itself is a study in modern living, featuring a well-appointed bedroom, a living area equipped with a flat-screen TV offering satellite channels, and a kitchen that leaves nothing to be desired. Complete with a fridge, kitchenware, and even a washing machine, it ensures all the comforts of home are at guests' fingertips. The inclusion of a bathroom with a walk-in shower adds an extra layer of convenience.

One of the highlights of YELLOW ROOM is undoubtedly its outdoor dining area, where guests can savor their meals against the backdrop of stunning sea views, making every dining experience memorable. Additionally, the presence of an on-site bar elevates the living experience, providing a cozy spot for evening relaxation.

Located just a short walk from the vibrant Durres Beach and within a manageable distance from Skanderbeg Square, the apartment serves as an ideal base for both relaxation and adventure. For international travelers, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 32 km away, adds to the appeal, making YELLOW ROOM a compelling choice for those visiting Durrës.
