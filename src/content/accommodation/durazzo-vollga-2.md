The apartment itself is a study in spaciousness and modern amenities. With two well-appointed bedrooms and two bathrooms, it caters effortlessly to families or groups. The inclusion of bed linen, towels, and a flat-screen TV adds a layer of convenience, while the fully equipped kitchen and dining area invite guests to feel at home. Perhaps the most captivating feature is the terrace, offering breathtaking sea views - an ideal backdrop for meals in the outdoor dining area, promising serene street views.

Beyond the confines of the apartment, Durazzo Vollga 2 is strategically located, with Skanderbeg Square and the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car within a reasonable distance, offering a glimpse into the rich culture and natural beauty of the area. For those traveling by air, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, just 34 km away, adds an extra layer of ease to travel arrangements.

In essence, Durazzo Vollga 2 stands as a testament to thoughtful accommodation that marries the convenience of modern living with the enchanting beauty of Durrës's coastal landscape.
