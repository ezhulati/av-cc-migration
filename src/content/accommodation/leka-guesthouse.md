The property prides itself on being a smoke-free environment, ensuring a clean and healthy stay for all guests. Each of the three air-conditioned bedrooms opens up to a balcony that overlooks the lush garden, providing a perfect backdrop for a morning coffee or an evening unwind. The holiday home is thoughtfully equipped with towels and bed linen, adding a touch of convenience to your stay.

For those concerned about privacy and noise, Leka GuestHouse has taken meticulous care to include soundproofing and a private entrance, guaranteeing an undisturbed and personal experience. Despite its secluded feel, the property remains within reach of the outside world, with Ioannina Airport located just 82 km away, making it an accessible escape for both local and international travelers.
