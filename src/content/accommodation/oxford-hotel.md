Each room in the Oxford Hotel is a testament to sophisticated living, boasting high ceilings that enhance the sense of space, complemented by a tasteful mix of classic and contemporary design elements. Modern comforts are not overlooked, with each room equipped with air conditioning, a flat-screen TV, a safe, and a minibar. The private bathrooms are equally impressive, featuring walk-in showers, complimentary toiletries, and hairdryers, with select rooms offering the added luxury of a balcony.

The hotel's commitment to exceptional service is evident in its round-the-clock reception, alongside a range of conveniences including ironing and laundry services, room service, and facilities for business meetings. The on-site cocktail bar, with its city-view terrace, and the lounge cafe, serving snacks and Austrian cakes in a garden seating area, provide perfect spots for relaxation. For wine enthusiasts, the underground wine cellar's tastings are a must-experience.

Located just a 2-minute walk from the city center, guests are perfectly positioned to explore. The National Library, National Museum and Theatre, along with numerous cultural and historic sites, are just a few steps away. Shopping enthusiasts will appreciate the proximity to a large shopping center, a mere 5-minute walk from the hotel. For those arriving by public transport, the Main Bus Station is within a 7-minute walk, and the Train Station is only 1.5 km away. Tirana Airport is conveniently located 18.5 km from the hotel, making Oxford Hotel an ideal choice for both business and leisure travelers seeking a blend of convenience, comfort, and culture.
