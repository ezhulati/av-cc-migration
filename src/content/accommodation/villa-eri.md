It is thoughtfully designed with two separate bedrooms, a cozy living room, a fully equipped kitchen for those who love to cook, and a bathroom. Entertainment is readily available with a flat-screen TV, catering to guests' diverse viewing preferences. Importantly, the villa maintains a non-smoking environment, ensuring a clean and fresh atmosphere.
