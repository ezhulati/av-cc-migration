Located a mere 48 km from the historic Visoki Dečani Monastery, the property prides itself on being a smoke-free environment, catering to the comfort and well-being of all guests. The villa itself is a testament to thoughtful living spaces, featuring two cozy bedrooms, a living room equipped with a flat-screen TV for entertainment, an equipped kitchen for those who love to prepare their meals, and two well-appointed bathrooms, each with a bidet and shower. For added convenience, a laundry service is readily available, ensuring a hassle-free stay.

The outdoor space of Big Garden Wood House is equally inviting, with a terrace that offers a tranquil spot for relaxation and a garden that invites guests to unwind in the midst of nature.

For travelers concerned about accessibility, Pristina International Airport is located 125 km away, making the villa a feasible option for both local and international guests. Big Garden Wood House emerges as a top choice for those in search of a comfortable and serene stay, away from the hustle and bustle of city life.
