The guest house prides itself on its variety of family rooms, each thoughtfully designed with the comfort of its guests in mind. Select rooms feature a private entrance, ensuring an exclusive and undisturbed experience. Guests will appreciate the thoughtful touches such as a wardrobe, outdoor furniture, and for some, a terrace that invites relaxation. The inclusion of a seating area with a flat-screen TV, alongside air conditioning and heating, guarantees comfort in any season. Moreover, certain units are enhanced with the convenience of a coffee machine and the delightful addition of fruits.

For those who prefer to cater to their own needs, a minimarket on the premises offers a range of essentials and more. Ilias House is not just about comfortable lodging; it's an invitation to immerse in local activities. Whether it's cycling, fishing, or hiking, the area surrounding Ksamil offers an array of options for outdoor enthusiasts. Additionally, the guest house features a picnic area, perfect for those wishing to enjoy a day under the open sky.

Its proximity to popular beaches adds to its appeal, with Coco Beach less than 1 km away and Sunset Beach a mere 10-minute walk, making it an ideal base for beach lovers. For international travelers, Corfu International Airport is 93 km away, making Ilias House accessible yet comfortably distanced from the hustle and bustle.

In summary, Ilias House stands out as a beacon of comfort, convenience, and natural beauty, promising an unforgettable stay for those venturing to Ksamil.
