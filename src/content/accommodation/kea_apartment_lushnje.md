The apartment itself is a testament to spacious living, featuring three well-appointed bedrooms that promise restful nights. Entertainment and connectivity are at guests' fingertips, thanks to the inclusion of a cable flat-screen TV. A dining area provides the perfect setting for meals, whether they're home-cooked in the fully equipped kitchen or delivered from one of the many nearby eateries.

For those traveling to or from the area, the convenience of being located 78 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport adds an extra layer of appeal, making Kea\_Apartment\_Lushnjë a compelling choice for both short and extended stays in Lushnjë.
