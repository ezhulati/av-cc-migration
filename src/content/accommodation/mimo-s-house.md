Guests at Mimo's House are treated to modern comforts within its cozy confines. The villa boasts a single bedroom, but what it lacks in size, it more than makes up for in amenities. A flat-screen TV, washing machine, and a kitchen equipped with an oven and fridge cater to the needs of the modern traveler. The provision of towels and bed linen adds a touch of home. The villa's thoughtful design includes a private entrance, ensuring an undisturbed and intimate stay.

For those looking to explore beyond the immediate comforts of Mimo's House, the historical Kuzum Baba and the iconic Independence Square are within a reasonable distance, offering a glimpse into the rich tapestry of Vlorë's past. For international guests, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is accessible, located 157 km away, making Mimo's House an ideal base for both local and foreign visitors seeking a blend of convenience, comfort, and exploration in Vlorë.
