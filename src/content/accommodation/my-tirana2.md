Guests are treated to air-conditioned accommodations that boast not only city views but also the tranquility of quiet street vistas, a rare find in such a central location. The Rock of Kavaje, 43 km away, adds to the list of nearby attractions, making My Tirana2 an ideal base for exploring the city's surroundings.

The apartments themselves are a haven of comfort, featuring patios or terraces that invite guests to relax and soak in the mountain views. Each unit is equipped with a seating area, a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a fully equipped kitchen with a fridge and stovetop, allowing guests the freedom to prepare their own meals. The inclusion of a private bathroom with shower and slippers, along with complimentary WiFi, bed linen, and towels, ensures a stay that combines the conveniences of home with the luxuries of hotel living.

Situated close to Rinia Park, the Pyramid of Tirana, and the iconic Reja - The Cloud, My Tirana2 is not just a place to stay but a gateway to experiencing the cultural heartbeat of the city. With the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport only 14 km away, it offers ease of access for international travelers, making it a compelling choice for those looking to immerse themselves in the vibrant life of Tirana.
