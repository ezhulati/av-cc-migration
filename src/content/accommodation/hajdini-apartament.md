The apartment itself is a testament to thoughtful design and comfort, featuring two cozy bedrooms, a bathroom equipped with a bidet and dressing room, and the convenience of free private parking. The inclusion of bed linen, towels, a flat-screen TV with cable channels, and a fully equipped kitchen ensures a stay that combines the comforts of home with the luxuries of a getaway. The terrace, offering breathtaking sea views, serves as the perfect backdrop for morning coffees or evening relaxation.

Adding to the appeal, the property boasts air-conditioning for those warmer Mediterranean days, and the assurance of privacy and security, thanks to a private entrance and round-the-clock security. For those looking to explore beyond the beach, Butrint National Park lies just 16 km away, offering a glimpse into the area's rich history and natural beauty.

Situated 96 km from Ioannina Airport, Hajdini Apartament presents an ideal retreat for those seeking a blend of relaxation, convenience, and exploration in the heart of Saranda.
