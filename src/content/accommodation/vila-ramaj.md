The villa itself is a testament to modern living combined with home comforts, featuring three well-appointed bedrooms, a fully equipped kitchen with modern appliances including an oven and a fridge, and a cozy seating area perfect for unwinding. Entertainment needs are met with a flat-screen TV, and the presence of two bathrooms, each with a bidet, ensures a comfortable stay for all guests. Importantly, Vila Ramaj maintains a non-smoking environment throughout, ensuring a clean and fresh atmosphere.

Situated a distance from the hustle and bustle, yet only 123 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, this villa offers an ideal blend of accessibility and seclusion. Vila Ramaj stands out as a prime choice for those seeking a peaceful escape in the picturesque setting of Berat.
