The apartment itself is a testament to thoughtful design and comfort, featuring a spacious layout that includes two bedrooms, a living room, and a terrace that boasts stunning sea views. The inclusion of a hot tub adds a touch of luxury, ensuring relaxation is never more than a few steps away. For those who love to cook, the equipped kitchen with an oven and microwave provides everything needed to prepare meals. The convenience of two bathrooms with walk-in showers, along with the provision of bed linen, towels, and laundry service, underscores the apartment's commitment to guest comfort.

Adding to the appeal is the apartment's balcony, which not only offers views of the surrounding mountains but also comes furnished, making it an ideal spot for enjoying the outdoors in privacy. The presence of free WiFi throughout the property and a lift ensures that guests' needs are met with modern conveniences.

For those looking to unwind with a drink, the on-site bar serves as a cozy spot to relax after a day of exploration. The apartment's proximity to notable landmarks such as Independence Square and Kuzum Baba, both 2 km away, positions it perfectly for guests eager to delve into the local culture and history.

Situated 150 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, Hana Apartment Hot Tub represents an excellent choice for travelers looking for a serene retreat that doesn't compromise on accessibility or comfort.
