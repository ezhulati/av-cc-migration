The highlight of Studio 663 is undoubtedly its elegantly appointed apartment.

The space is thoughtfully designed with a cozy bedroom, a welcoming living room equipped with a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a fully equipped kitchen featuring a microwave and fridge for home-cooked meals. The inclusion of a modern bathroom with a bidet adds a touch of comfort to the living experience. Importantly, the accommodation upholds a non-smoking policy, ensuring a fresh and inviting environment for all guests.
