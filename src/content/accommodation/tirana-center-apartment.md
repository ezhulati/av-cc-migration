A mere stone's throw from the historical Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, and a convenient 44 km from the Rock of Kavaje, guests are perfectly positioned to explore the rich tapestry of Tirana's past and present. The apartment itself offers a generous layout, featuring two well-appointed bedrooms, a living area with a flat-screen TV equipped with cable channels, and a kitchen that leaves nothing to be desired, complete with a dishwasher, oven, and even a washing machine for those longer stays. The inclusion of a bidet in the bathroom, along with complimentary towels and bed linen, adds a touch of home comfort to the modern amenities.

For those who enjoy starting their day with a freshly brewed cup of coffee, the on-site coffee shop caters to all caffeine needs. Additionally, the availability of a car rental service directly from the apartment opens up endless possibilities for exploration and adventure in and around Tirana.

Noteworthy nearby attractions include Rinia Park, the Pyramid of Tirana, and the National Gallery of Arts, all of which are within easy walking distance. For guests arriving by air, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is a mere 15 km away, with the apartment offering a paid shuttle service for a seamless transition from air to accommodation.

Tirana Center Apartment stands out as an ideal lodging option for those looking to immerse themselves in the vibrant culture and history of Albania's capital, all while enjoying the comforts of a thoughtfully equipped and strategically located home away from home.
