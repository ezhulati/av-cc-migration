Each apartment is thoughtfully designed with air conditioning for those warm Mediterranean days and comes equipped with a fully functional kitchen, including a fridge, catering to the needs of guests preferring home-cooked meals.

Situated a mere 4.7 km from the historic Kuzum Baba and 4.9 km from the vibrant Independence Square, Ari Apartments serves as an ideal base for exploring the rich cultural tapestry of Vlorë. For those venturing further, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is 154 km away, making it a manageable distance for international travelers.
