The apartment itself is a testament to spacious living, boasting two well-appointed bedrooms and two bathrooms, ensuring ample space for guests. The inclusion of bed linen, towels, a flat-screen TV equipped with streaming services, a dining area, and a fully equipped kitchen, cater to the needs of modern travelers. The balcony offers serene mountain views, adding a touch of tranquility to the stay. Comfort is further enhanced by air conditioning, a cozy seating area, a washing machine, and two bathrooms equipped with both a bidet and a bath. An added luxury is the outdoor dining area, perfect for enjoying meals in the fresh air.

For convenience, a minimarket on the premises means essentials are never far away. And for those looking to explore beyond, Podgorica Airport is conveniently located 58 km from the apartment, making Sole & Luna Apartment an ideal base for both short and extended stays in the region.
