The apartment itself is a haven of space and comfort, boasting two well-appointed bedrooms and a fully equipped kitchen, complete with an oven and fridge, ensuring a home-away-from-home experience. The living area, adorned with a flat-screen TV and cozy seating, invites guests to relax after a day of city exploration. The convenience of a private bathroom, equipped with a bidet, along with the provision of towels and bed linen, adds to the seamless stay experience. Additionally, the unique feature of a dressing room offers an added layer of privacy and convenience for guests.

OVI's Home is not just about the comfort within but also about the ease of access to Tirana's cultural and entertainment venues. A short distance away is the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet of Albania, the National Museum of History, and the Toptani Shopping Centre, catering to both cultural aficionados and shopping enthusiasts. For those traveling to and from Tirana, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is a mere 14 km away, making OVI's Home an ideal base for both short-term visits and longer stays in this dynamic city.
