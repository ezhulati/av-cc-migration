Following a thoughtful renovation, the apartment presents a harmonious blend of comfort and style. It features a single bedroom, adorned with crisp linens, alongside a living space equipped with a flat-screen TV for those relaxing nights in. The kitchen doesn't disappoint either, coming fully stocked with an oven, fridge, washing machine, stovetop, and an array of kitchenware, perfect for those who enjoy the art of cooking even while away from home. Towels and bed linen are thoughtfully provided, adding to the convenience of your stay.

For those keen on exploring beyond the local beaches, Butrint National Park offers a slice of nature's best, located just 17 km away. And for travelers concerned about connectivity, Ioannina Airport is within a manageable distance, sitting 97 km from the apartment, making arrivals and departures as smooth as possible. The Cosy apartment in Sarandë is more than just a place to stay; it's a gateway to experiencing the beauty and tranquility of the Albanian Riviera.
