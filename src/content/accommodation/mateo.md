For beach enthusiasts, the proximity to Maracit Beach, merely a 300-meter stroll, and Prinos Beach, located 700 meters away, makes Mateo an ideal base for soaking up the sun and enjoying the coastal ambiance. Furthermore, for those venturing from afar, Ioannina Airport is situated 143 km from the hostel, making it a feasible option for international and domestic travelers alike.
