What sets our accommodation apart is its spacious layout. It features two well-appointed bedrooms, a bathroom, and a kitchen with everything you need for a self-sufficient stay. We've designed our space with your comfort and convenience in mind.

Guests can enjoy the added luxury of a balcony, perfect for taking in the local atmosphere. Entertainment needs are met with a flat-screen TV, ensuring a cozy night in is always an option.

For those concerned about health and wellness, it's noteworthy that the apartment maintains a strict non-smoking policy. Situated a scenic drive from Zaravina Lake, only 45 km away, and with Ioannina Airport 83 km from the doorstep, Elida Apartments positions itself as an ideal base for exploring the enchanting surroundings of Gjirokastër.
