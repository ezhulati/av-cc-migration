This air-conditioned haven offers more than just a place to rest; it's a spacious retreat equipped with modern amenities and designed for ultimate relaxation. The apartment boasts a well-appointed bedroom, a sleek flat-screen TV, and a kitchen that caters to every culinary need with a dishwasher, oven, washing machine, microwave, and fridge. The highlight, however, is the breathtaking sea views from the patio, furnished for guests to unwind and soak in the tranquil surroundings. The thoughtful addition of soundproofing and a private entrance ensures an undisturbed and personalized stay.

For those arriving from afar, the convenience of a paid airport shuttle service from Ioannina airport, located 98 km away, adds to the seamless experience. Jusal Sea View Apartment doesn't just offer a stay; it promises a memorable escape with the comfort of home and the luxury of privacy and serene views.
