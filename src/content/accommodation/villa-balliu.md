Accommodations at Villa Balliu are thoughtfully designed with guest comfort in mind, featuring fully equipped kitchens, private bathrooms, and either a balcony or terrace that opens up to the lush garden views. The inclusion of a wardrobe in every unit adds a touch of home, ensuring a comfortable and organized stay.

For families or those traveling in groups, the availability of family rooms underscores the guest house's dedication to catering to the needs of all guests. Its location is a perfect base for exploring, situated just a short drive from the Early Christian Basilica, and equally convenient to both Port Ohrid and the iconic Church of St. John at Kaneo, each approximately 34 km away. For those traveling by air, Ohrid Airport is conveniently located 40 km from the property, making Villa Balliu an accessible choice for both domestic and international travelers seeking a peaceful escape amidst nature's beauty.
