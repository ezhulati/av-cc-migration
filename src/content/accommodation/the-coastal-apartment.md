Accommodating guests with two cozy bedrooms, the apartment is well-appointed with a fully equipped kitchen and a bathroom, making it an ideal home away from home. The inclusion of towels and bed linen adds a touch of thoughtfulness to the overall experience.

Situated a mere 2.2 km from the vibrant Coco Bongo Beach, The Coastal Apartment also provides easy access to local landmarks such as Kuzum Baba and Independence Square, located 6.7 km and 6.9 km away, respectively. For international travelers, the convenience of Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, positioned 156 km from the property, ensures a hassle-free connection to and from this charming coastal retreat.
