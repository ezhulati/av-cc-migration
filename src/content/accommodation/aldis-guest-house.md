The guest house features a spacious apartment that is thoughtfully designed with two bedrooms and two bathrooms, making it an ideal choice for families or groups. The inclusion of bed linen, towels, a flat-screen TV, and a fully equipped kitchen adds to the convenience, allowing guests to feel at home. The highlight, however, is the terrace that offers breathtaking sea views, complemented by an outdoor dining area that overlooks the well-maintained garden, perfect for enjoying meals in a picturesque setting.

For those looking to unwind, the in-house bar serves as a cozy retreat, while the on-site minimarket caters to any last-minute needs. Aldi's Guest House does not fall short in offering leisure activities, with options like diving available for the adventurous. Families will appreciate the kids' pool, and the garden provides a tranquil space for relaxation.

Situated within easy reach of popular spots like the Beach at Government Villas and Coco Bongo Beach, guests have the opportunity to explore the local area's attractions. Despite its secluded feel, the property remains accessible, with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport located 156 km away, making it a convenient option for both domestic and international travelers.

Aldi's Guest House stands as a testament to the perfect blend of accessibility, comfort, and scenic beauty, promising an unforgettable stay in Vlorë.
