This property, strictly non-smoking, positions itself a mere 41 km from the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, offering guests a unique blend of beachside relaxation and adventure. The apartment itself is a study in spaciousness and comfort, featuring two well-appointed bedrooms, a cozy living room for unwinding, a fully equipped kitchen for those who love to cook, and a modern bathroom. Entertainment needs are met with the provision of a flat-screen TV, ensuring guests have all they need for a memorable stay.

For those who enjoy a good drink, the convenience of an on-site bar adds to the appeal, making it easy to enjoy evenings without venturing far. The Rock of Kavaje, a notable landmark, is located just 7.1 km away, offering an easy excursion option. Additionally, the apartment is situated 38 km from the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, providing a cultural outing for those interested in exploring the history of the area.

Accessibility is also a strong point, with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport only 32 km away, making Appartamenti Nicola an excellent choice for both international travelers and those exploring Albania.
