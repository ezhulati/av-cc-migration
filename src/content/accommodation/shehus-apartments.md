The apartment itself is a testament to comfort and privacy, featuring air conditioning for those warm Mediterranean days. It includes one separate bedroom, a cozy living room, and a fully equipped kitchen with modern amenities such as an oven and fridge, ensuring guests feel right at home. The inclusion of a balcony, which serves as an enchanting outdoor dining area, allows for memorable meals against a backdrop of sea and mountain views. The commitment to a non-smoking environment and the provision of a private entrance underscore the property's dedication to guest privacy and comfort.

For convenience, a minimarket on the premises caters to guests' everyday needs, adding an extra layer of ease to their stay. Adventure seekers and nature enthusiasts will find the apartment's proximity to VIP Beach and Butrint National Park-1.5 km and 15 km away, respectively-an irresistible lure, offering opportunities for exploration and discovery. Despite its tranquil setting, Shehu's Apartments remains well-connected, with Ioannina Airport located 95 km away, ensuring smooth arrivals and departures.

Shehu's Apartments stands out as a prime choice for travelers seeking a blend of serenity, comfort, and convenience in Sarandë. Its strategic location, coupled with thoughtful amenities, makes it an ideal base for both relaxation and adventure in one of Albania's most sought-after destinations.
