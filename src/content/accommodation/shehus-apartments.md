The inclusion of a balcony, which serves as an enchanting outdoor dining area, allows for memorable meals against a backdrop of sea and mountain views. The commitment to a non-smoking environment and the provision of a private entrance underscore the property's dedication to guest privacy and comfort.

For convenience, a minimarket on the premises caters to guests' everyday needs, adding an extra layer of ease to their stay. Adventure seekers and nature enthusiasts will find the apartment's proximity to VIP Beach and Butrint National Park-1.5 km and 15 km away, respectively-an irresistible lure, offering opportunities for exploration and discovery.
