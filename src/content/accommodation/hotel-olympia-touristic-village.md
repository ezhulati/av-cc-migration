Each room in the Hotel Olympia Touristic Village is a testament to thoughtful hospitality, equipped with a flat-screen TV, air conditioning, and a private balcony for those serene moments overlooking the sea. The en-suite bathrooms are well-appointed with complimentary toiletries and a bidet, adding a touch of luxury to the everyday routine. The promise of a sea view from every room elevates the experience, allowing guests to wake up to the tranquil beauty of Radhime's shores.

The hotel doesn't just stop at comfortable lodging. It extends its hospitality to include a 24-hour front desk, ensuring assistance is always at hand, and a shared terrace that invites guests to relax and mingle. For those looking to explore beyond the hotel's confines, a shuttle service is available, albeit at an additional cost, making local attractions easily accessible.

Speaking of attractions, Hotel Olympia Touristic Village serves as an ideal base for exploring the region's landmarks. It's conveniently located within a short drive from the Kuzum Babai viewpoint, Independence Square, and the historic town of Vlora, each offering a unique glimpse into the area's rich culture and history. Vlora Castle, another must-visit site, is also within easy reach.

For guests arriving by bus or ferry, the hotel is conveniently situated 12 km from both the Bus Station and Ferry Port, making it a hassle-free choice for travelers. Even those flying into Tirana Airport will find the 160 km journey to the hotel a small price to pay for the tranquility that awaits.
