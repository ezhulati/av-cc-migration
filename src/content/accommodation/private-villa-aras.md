The villa itself is a testament to modern living, boasting an air-conditioned space that encompasses a separate bedroom, a cozy living room, a fully equipped kitchen for those who love to cook, and a well-appointed bathroom. Entertainment needs are catered to with a flat-screen TV, ensuring guests have everything they need for a relaxing stay.

Adding to the appeal, Private Villa Aras ensures peace of mind with complimentary private parking and the convenience of free WiFi throughout the premises. The commitment to a smoke-free environment further enhances the villa's appeal to those seeking a pure and undisturbed escape.

For travelers venturing from afar, the villa's proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 150 km away, makes it an accessible haven for both local and international guests seeking a blend of tranquility and accessibility in the heart of Vlorë.
