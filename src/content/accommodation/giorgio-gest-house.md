The apartment itself is a study in spaciousness and comfort, featuring two well-appointed bedrooms and a living room designed for relaxation. Entertainment is readily available via a flat-screen TV, while the equipped kitchen, complete with an oven and fridge, invites guests to prepare their meals just the way they like them. The inclusion of a bathroom with a shower and a dedicated dressing room enhances the convenience factor, making it easy for guests to refresh and unwind after a day of exploration.

Situated 90 km from Ioannina Airport, Giorgio Gest House is accessible yet feels like a world apart, offering a tranquil retreat from the hustle and bustle. Whether it's the mountain views from the terrace or the thoughtful amenities, this property ensures a memorable stay for all who visit.
