This smoke-free property presents a cozy air-conditioned apartment that is thoughtfully designed with a bedroom, a well-appointed kitchenette, and a bathroom, catering to the needs of guests seeking a comfortable stay. The addition of a private entrance underscores the accommodation's commitment to privacy and exclusivity.

Strategically located, Sunset Cottage 2 is a stone's throw away from the allure of Ksamil Beach 9, just 400 meters to be precise, and a leisurely stroll from Lori Beach, situated 600 meters away. For those intrigued by natural and historical explorations, Butrint National Park offers a rich tapestry of biodiversity and archaeological treasures within a 3 km reach. Moreover, for international travelers, Corfu International Airport is accessible, located 92 km from the property, making Sunset Cottage 2 an ideal choice for both relaxation and adventure in the heart of Ksamil.
