The apartment itself is a spacious retreat, boasting a balcony that offers tranquil garden views, two cozy bedrooms, a welcoming living room, and a kitchen equipped with everything needed for a home-cooked meal. Entertainment is readily available through the inclusion of a flat-screen TV, ensuring relaxation is on the agenda.

For those looking to start their day with a caffeine kick or needing a bite on the go, the on-site coffee shop and the option for packed lunches cater to every culinary need.

Strategically positioned, Albanian Traditions Legacy is a mere 5.3 km from the Rock of Kavaje, making it an ideal base for explorers. Additionally, the historical significance of the area is underscored by its proximity to the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha. For guests arriving by air, the convenience is further enhanced by the availability of a paid airport shuttle service from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 32 km away.

Albanian Traditions Legacy not only promises a stay that is as relaxing as it is enriching but also serves as a gateway to the rich tapestry of Albanian culture and history.
