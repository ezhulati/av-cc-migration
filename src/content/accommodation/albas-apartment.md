Guests are welcomed into a generously sized apartment that boasts a balcony offering a slice of Vlorë's serene environment. The layout is thoughtfully designed, featuring a single bedroom complemented by a spacious living area and a kitchen equipped with everything needed for a self-sufficient stay. The provision of towels and bed linen adds a touch of home, ensuring a comfortable and hassle-free experience.

For those keen on exploring, the apartment's location serves as an ideal base. The allure of Vlore Beach is just 200 meters away, inviting guests for leisurely strolls or refreshing swims. Further afield, the historical sites of Kuzum Baba and Independence Square are within easy reach, located 3.3 km and 3.6 km away, respectively, offering a glimpse into the rich tapestry of the area's heritage.

Situated 153 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, Alba's Apartment represents an excellent choice for both short and extended stays, promising a blend of convenience, comfort, and the opportunity to immerse in the local culture of Vlorë.
