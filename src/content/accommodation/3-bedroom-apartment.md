The apartment itself boasts a generous layout, featuring three well-appointed bedrooms, a cozy living room for relaxation, and a fully equipped kitchen for those who enjoy the comforts of home-cooked meals. The inclusion of a flat-screen TV ensures entertainment is always at hand, and the strict non-smoking policy guarantees a fresh and inviting environment for all guests.

Situated conveniently close to Skanderbeg Square, the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet of Albania, and the National Museum of History Albania, visitors have the cultural heart of the city at their doorstep. For those traveling further afield, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is just 14 km away, making the 3 Bedroom Apartment an ideal base for both short and extended stays in Tirana. Despite its central location, guests can enjoy the peace of mind that comes with available private parking, albeit for a nominal extra charge.

With free WiFi throughout the property, staying connected with loved ones or planning the next day's adventures is effortless. The 3 Bedroom Apartment stands out as a top-tier accommodation choice for those who value space, privacy, and the convenience of a prime location in Tirana.
