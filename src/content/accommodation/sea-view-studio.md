The apartment itself is a testament to modern living, boasting a single bedroom outfitted with a flat-screen TV for entertainment. The presence of a fully equipped kitchen, featuring a microwave and a fridge, alongside a washing machine, caters to the practical needs of guests, ensuring a home-away-from-home experience. The bathroom, complete with either a bath or shower, adds to the comfort of the stay.

One of the standout features of Sea View Studio is the outdoor dining area, inviting guests to savor their meals against the backdrop of the picturesque surroundings, enhancing the overall experience of their stay.

For those keen to explore, the apartment's location serves as an ideal base. Kuzum Baba and Independence Square are within easy reach, located 3.5 km and 3.7 km away, respectively, offering a glimpse into the local culture and history. For international travelers, the convenience of Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, situated 152 km from the property, ensures seamless connectivity.

In summary, Sea View Studio presents a compelling option for those in pursuit of a tranquil coastal escape in Vlorë, equipped with all the essentials for a comfortable and enjoyable stay.
