Guests can enjoy the luxury of a private, air-conditioned apartment featuring a separate bedroom, a cozy living room, a fully equipped kitchen for those who love to cook, and a modern bathroom. Entertainment needs are met with a flat-screen TV, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration. The commitment to a non-smoking environment ensures a clean and fresh stay for all guests.

Connectivity is never an issue, as free WiFi is available throughout the property, and for those arriving by car, private parking is available at an additional charge. The apartment's proximity to notable attractions such as the National Museum of History Albania, Toptani Shopping Centre, and National Gallery of Arts Tirana adds to its appeal, making it an ideal base for cultural enthusiasts and shopping aficionados alike. For ease of travel, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is a mere 14 km away, making Apartment Centre View New Bazaar a top choice for both short visits and extended stays in Tirana.
