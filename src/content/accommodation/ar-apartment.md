The accommodation features a single bedroom, but its appeal is far from limited. A fully equipped kitchen awaits culinary enthusiasts, complete with a toaster and fridge, alongside a washing machine for those longer stays. The bathroom doesn't skimp on necessities either, offering a hair dryer and complimentary toiletries. Perhaps the most enchanting aspect is the opportunity to dine al fresco in the outdoor dining area, where meals are complemented by breathtaking mountain views. Privacy and security are paramount, with a private entrance for guests and round-the-clock security ensuring a worry-free stay.

For those needing essentials or a quick snack, a minimarket on the premises caters to convenience. Situated just a short drive from cultural landmarks like Kuzum Baba and Independence Square, both 2.8 km away, Ar Apartment serves as an ideal base for explorers. For international travelers, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport lies 151 km away, with the apartment offering a paid shuttle service for seamless arrivals and departures.

Ar Apartment stands out as a meticulously designed haven in Vlorë, promising an unforgettable stay with its blend of modern amenities, strategic location, and unwavering commitment to guest comfort and security.
