The apartment itself is a testament to modern living, featuring a spacious terrace that overlooks the sea. It is well-appointed with a cozy bedroom, a living area complete with a flat-screen TV, and a fully equipped kitchen that includes a dishwasher and an oven for those who prefer to dine in. The inclusion of a bidet in the bathroom, along with towels and bed linen, adds a touch of home comfort. Importantly, Dolphin 513 is committed to providing a smoke-free environment.

For guests looking to enjoy a leisurely cup of coffee or needing to pick up essentials, the property houses a coffee shop and a minimarket. Its location is particularly appealing for beach enthusiasts; Qerret Beach is merely steps away, offering easy access to sun, sand, and sea, while Mali I Robit Beach is located just 2.2 km from the apartment. For those traveling by air, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is 44 km away, with the added convenience of airport transfers and car rental services offered by Dolphin 513.

In summary, Dolphin 513 stands out as an ideal spot for those looking to experience the beauty of Golem, providing a comfortable and convenient base from which to explore the surrounding beaches and local attractions.
