This ground-floor apartment doesn't just offer a place to stay; it provides a spacious retreat equipped with modern amenities and thoughtful touches. Housing three well-appointed bedrooms, the accommodation ensures a restful night's sleep for all. The living space is enhanced by a flat-screen TV with satellite channels, ensuring entertainment is always at hand. The heart of the home, a fully equipped kitchen, comes complete with a dishwasher, oven, washing machine, microwave, and fridge, catering to every culinary need.

The allure of Botanic Loft is further magnified by its outdoor offerings. A balcony, adorned with outdoor furniture, presents a serene spot to enjoy the mountain views, while the inclusion of a seating area and a fireplace inside invites guests to relax and unwind in style.

Accessibility is another hallmark of this esteemed property. The Grand Park of Tirana and the poignant Postbllok - Checkpoint Monument are both located just 2.7 km away, making for easy exploration. For those traveling further afield, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is conveniently 16 km from the apartment, ensuring smooth transitions to and from the city.

With the promise of free private parking and complimentary WiFi, Botanic Loft stands as a beacon of hospitality, offering a seamless and enriching stay for those venturing into the heart of Tirana.
