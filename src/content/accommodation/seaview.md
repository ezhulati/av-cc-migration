The apartment itself is a testament to spacious living, featuring two well-appointed bedrooms, a cozy living room, and a kitchen equipped with everything needed for a home-cooked meal. Not to mention, the inclusion of two modern bathrooms adds a layer of convenience. From the comfort of the balcony, guests are treated to picturesque garden views, offering a perfect backdrop for a morning coffee or an evening unwind.

For those looking to explore beyond the immediate comforts of Seaview, Vjetër Beach awaits at a short distance of 2.4 km, while the historic Kuzum Baba can be reached within 3.3 km. For international travelers, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is the nearest gateway, located 152 km away, making Seaview an accessible retreat for both local and foreign visitors in search of a tranquil coastal experience in Vlorë.
