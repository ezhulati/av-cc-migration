The villa itself is a testament to modern living in a natural setting, boasting three elegantly furnished bedrooms and two well-appointed bathrooms, complete with bed linen and towels for the utmost comfort. Entertainment is readily available through a flat-screen TV equipped with streaming services, ensuring guests are never at a loss for things to do. The heart of the villa, a fully equipped kitchen, opens up to a dining area, making meal times a delightful experience. Perhaps the crown jewel of Kallmet Villa is its terrace, offering unparalleled mountain views, and a balcony that overlooks the pristine pool, complete with outdoor furniture for those moments of relaxation under the sky.

For those who cherish the outdoors, the villa complex presents a picnic area, perfect for a day spent basking in the sun or enjoying a meal amidst nature.

Accessibility is hardly an issue, with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport merely 56 km away, making Kallmet Villa an easily reachable destination for both local and international travelers. This villa is not just a place to stay; it's a gateway to experiencing the beauty and tranquility of Kallmeti i Madh, promising an unforgettable stay for all who visit.
