The apartment itself is a testament to thoughtful design and comfort. Guests are greeted with a spacious layout that includes a bedroom, a living room equipped with a flat-screen TV, and a balcony that offers serene garden views - an ideal spot for morning coffees or quiet evenings. The kitchen, equipped with a fridge and kitchenware, caters to those who prefer home-cooked meals, while the private bathroom with a shower adds to the convenience.

Privacy is paramount at Alda's Apartment, underscored by the inclusion of a private entrance for guests. This feature ensures an undisturbed and personal experience, making it feel like a home away from home.

Located a mere 1.6 km from the picturesque Shkëmbi i Kavajës Beach, the apartment also offers easy access to local attractions. Skanderbeg Square, the heart of Albanian culture and history, is 47 km away, while the Rock of Kavaje, a local landmark, is just 5.4 km from the doorstep. For those traveling by air, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is conveniently 41 km away, making Alda's Apartment an accessible and attractive choice for both domestic and international travelers seeking a peaceful beachside escape.
