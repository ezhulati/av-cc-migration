The apartment itself is a haven of space and light, boasting a generous layout that includes three well-appointed bedrooms, a cozy living room, and a balcony that offers serene garden views - a perfect setting for morning coffees or evening relaxation. The inclusion of a flat-screen TV, an equipped kitchen complete with an oven and toaster, and two modern bathrooms, one of which features a bidet, ensures guests have all the comforts of home at their fingertips. Additionally, the convenience of complimentary WiFi and private parking on site adds to the seamless experience of staying at Ioli's House.

For those who relish the outdoors, the property offers an inviting outdoor dining area, ideal for enjoying meals under the open sky. Despite its peaceful location, Ioli's House remains within easy reach of Tirana's vibrant heart, with Skanderbeg Square located 43 km away, and the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car offering scenic rides 47 km from the doorstep. Cultural enthusiasts will appreciate the proximity to the House of Leaves and the National Museum of History Albania, both within 43 km.

Accessibility is also a highlight, with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport just 28 km away, ensuring a hassle-free arrival and departure for international guests. Ioli's House presents a compelling choice for those in search of a tranquil escape that does not compromise on accessibility to Albania's cultural and historical gems.
