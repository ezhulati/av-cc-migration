The accommodations at XHEKO ROOMS are designed with the modern traveler in mind. Each room is equipped with essential amenities such as a wardrobe for personal belongings, a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a private bathroom. However, it's the balcony that truly sets these rooms apart, offering breathtaking sea views that promise to elevate the stay of every guest.

For those looking to explore the local area, Palasa Beach is just a short 1.5 km journey away, making it an easy destination for a day trip. Additionally, for guests traveling from afar, Ioannina Airport is located 161 km from the hotel, making XHEKO ROOMS a strategic choice for both domestic and international travelers seeking a serene retreat by the sea.
