The space is thoughtfully designed with a bedroom, a bathroom equipped with essential linens and towels, and a living area that includes a flat-screen TV for entertainment. The highlight, however, is the balcony that presents an unobstructed view of the sea, promising tranquil mornings and picturesque sunsets. The convenience extends to a fully equipped kitchenette, catering to those who prefer a home-cooked meal even while away from home.

For those looking to explore beyond the beach, the apartment is conveniently located within a manageable distance from major attractions. Skanderbeg Square, the heart of Tirana's cultural and historical landscape, is accessible, as is the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, offering an adventurous route to Dajti Mountain's natural beauty. Moreover, the property is situated 37 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, with a paid shuttle service available to ensure seamless travel arrangements.

VIVA Golem 2 emerges as a compelling choice for travelers seeking a blend of relaxation, convenience, and a touch of adventure in Durrës.
