The accommodations at Blue Residence are designed with the modern traveler in mind, featuring air-conditioned guest rooms that boast not only a balcony with captivating city views but also a cozy seating area for unwinding. The presence of a satellite flat-screen TV ensures entertainment is always at hand, while the fully equipped kitchen, complete with an oven, toaster, fridge, stovetop, and even a coffee machine and kettle, invites guests to feel at home. The convenience of a private bathroom with a walk-in shower and hairdryer, alongside the thoughtful inclusion of bed linen and towels in each unit, underscores the property's commitment to guest comfort.

Beyond the confines of their rooms, guests are welcomed to enjoy the serene garden, providing a tranquil escape or a delightful spot for a picnic. Although dining options beckon just a short stroll away, the freedom to prepare meals in the privacy of one's apartment adds a layer of personalization to the stay.

Strategically located, Blue Residence is not only a stone's throw away from the allure of Sarandë's beaches but also a mere 2.7 km from the serene Maestral Beach and 18 km from the historic Butrint National Park. For those arriving from afar, Ioannina Airport is the nearest gateway, located 98 km from the property, making Blue Residence an accessible haven for both local and international visitors.

With its blend of convenience, comfort, and location, Blue Residence stands as a testament to the ideal beachfront getaway, promising an unforgettable stay in Sarandë.
