The apartment itself is a testament to comfort and style, featuring a spacious layout that includes a living room complete with a seating and dining area, a fully equipped kitchen boasting modern appliances such as a dishwasher, oven, and microwave, alongside two cozy bedrooms and two well-appointed bathrooms equipped with a bidet and shower. The addition of a DVD player and a selection of fruits upon arrival adds a personal touch to the experience, while the soundproofing and non-smoking policy ensure a peaceful retreat.

Families will appreciate the thoughtful inclusion of a children's playground and outdoor furniture, making it an ideal choice for guests of all ages. For those seeking convenience, a coffee shop and a minimarket on the premises provide easy access to essentials and quick bites.

Beyond the comforts of the apartment, guests are encouraged to unwind in the shared lounge area, a perfect spot for relaxing after a day of exploration. The location of Home Sweet Home Tirana places guests in proximity to notable attractions such as the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, the Postbllok - Checkpoint Monument, and the Grand Park of Tirana, making it an excellent base for discovering the city's rich history and vibrant culture. With Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport just 15 km away, the apartment serves as a convenient and welcoming haven for both local and international travelers.
