Guests are welcomed into a generously sized apartment, complete with a balcony that invites relaxation. The layout includes two cozy bedrooms, a living area designed for leisure, and a kitchen equipped with everything needed for a home-cooked meal. Entertainment is readily available through the inclusion of a flat-screen TV, catering to those evenings in. Importantly, Lola Apartment maintains a non-smoking environment, ensuring a fresh and clean atmosphere for the duration of your stay.

For those considering travel logistics, it's worth noting that the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is located 119 km away, making the apartment a viable option for both local and international visitors.
