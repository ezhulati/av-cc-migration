The interior of the apartment reveals a thoughtfully arranged living space, featuring two cozy bedrooms, a bathroom, and a kitchen equipped with everything needed for a home-cooked meal. Entertainment is readily available through the inclusion of a flat-screen TV, ensuring relaxation after a day of exploration.

Situated a mere 3 km from Ri Beach and with the nearest airport, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 150 km away, the apartment serves as an ideal base for both beach lovers and those keen to explore the broader Vlorë region.
