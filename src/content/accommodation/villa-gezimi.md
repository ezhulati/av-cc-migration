The apartment complex is designed with the modern traveler in mind, featuring select units with their own private entrances, ensuring an exclusive and undisturbed stay. Each apartment is thoughtfully appointed with essential amenities including a wardrobe and outdoor furniture for that home-away-from-home feeling. For those seeking the ultimate in comfort, certain apartments are enhanced with air conditioning, a flat-screen TV, a washing machine, and a kettle, alongside a fully equipped kitchen for a truly self-sufficient stay. The assurance of a private bathroom with every unit adds to the convenience factor.

For guests looking to explore beyond the beach, the historic Butrint National Park is just 3 km away, offering a glimpse into the area's rich cultural heritage. Moreover, the proximity to Corfu International Airport, located 93 km from Villa Gezimi, facilitates easy access for international travelers. Villa Gezimi emerges as a top choice for those in search of a peaceful beachside getaway that doesn't compromise on comfort or convenience.
