The inclusion of towels and bed linen ensures a hassle-free stay, while the private entrance to the accommodation adds an extra layer of privacy for discerning guests.

For those who prefer the convenience of preparing their own meals or need to pick up a quick snack, a minimarket on the premises caters to all basic shopping needs. Additionally, the sun terrace invites guests to unwind and soak up the sun in a tranquil setting.

Beyond the comforts of the apartment, the surrounding area offers plenty to explore.

For travelers, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 42 km away, ensures easy access and convenience.
