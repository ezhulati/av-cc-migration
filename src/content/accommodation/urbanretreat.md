Following a recent renovation, the apartment boasts a modern aesthetic with a flat-screen TV equipped with streaming services, ensuring entertainment is always at hand. The fully equipped kitchen is a highlight, offering a dishwasher, oven, washing machine, toaster, and fridge, catering to all culinary needs. The provision of towels and bed linen adds a touch of home comfort. Designed with the guest's peace in mind, the apartment is both non-smoking and soundproof, ensuring a tranquil stay.

For convenience, a minimarket on the premises means essentials are never far away.

Cultural enthusiasts will find the apartment's location ideal, with the National Museum of History Albania, National Theatre of Opera and Ballet of Albania, and House of Leaves all within close proximity. For those traveling further afield, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is just 13 km away, making UrbanRetreat an excellent base for both exploring the city's sights and easy travel arrangements.
