In a commitment to ensuring a serene environment, Riviera proudly upholds a non-smoking policy, creating a fresh and inviting atmosphere for all guests. Positioned a mere 2.8 km from the historic Independence Square, the property serves as an ideal base for exploring the rich cultural tapestry of the area.

Guests are welcomed into a generously sized apartment, thoughtfully designed with two bedrooms, a cozy living room, a fully equipped kitchen ready to cater to culinary needs, and two well-appointed bathrooms, ensuring ample space and privacy for all. Entertainment needs are not overlooked, with a flat-screen TV readily available for leisurely viewing.

For those intrigued by local landmarks, Kuzum Baba awaits at a distance of 3.3 km, offering a glimpse into the area's heritage. Moreover, for travelers venturing from afar, the convenience of Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 150 km from Riviera, ensures a seamless travel experience to and from this coastal retreat.
