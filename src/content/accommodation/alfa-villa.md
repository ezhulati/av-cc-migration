The villa's interior is a testament to luxury living, featuring not just one, but two living rooms, each designed for relaxation and social gatherings, complemented by a dining area perfect for hosting. The kitchen doesn't disappoint either, being fully equipped with a dishwasher, oven, and microwave, catering to all culinary needs. Entertainment is readily available with a PS4, ensuring guests of all ages remain engaged. The accommodation boasts five well-appointed bedrooms and four bathrooms, including a hot tub and shower, promising a comfortable stay for larger groups or families. The outdoor dining area, overlooking lush garden views, offers an idyllic setting for meals under the sky.

For those who find solace in nature, the villa's garden provides a tranquil retreat. Situated strategically, Alfa Villa is a mere 43 km from the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, offering an adventure for those inclined to explore the heights, and 25 km from the Rock of Kavaje, presenting an opportunity for geological exploration. The Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is conveniently located 30 km away, making Alfa Villa an accessible haven for both local and international travelers.

Alfa Villa not only promises a stay filled with leisure and relaxation but also positions itself as a gateway to exploring the rich cultural and natural landscapes of the surrounding area.
