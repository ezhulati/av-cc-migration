The apartment itself is a testament to spacious living, boasting a balcony that invites guests to enjoy their morning coffee or evening relaxation outdoors. It features a generously sized bedroom, a cozy living room for unwinding after a day of exploration, and a well-equipped kitchen complete with a fridge, catering to those who prefer to prepare their meals. The inclusion of towels and bed linen adds a touch of home comfort to the experience.

Situated a mere 2.3 km from the serene Ri Beach, Del Mar Center Apartment also offers easy access to local landmarks such as Independence Square and Kuzum Baba, located 2.6 km and 3.1 km away, respectively. For guests arriving from afar, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is 151 km from the accommodation, making it a manageable distance for both short and extended stays.

Del Mar Center Apartment presents an ideal blend of location, convenience, and comfort, making it a top recommendation for those planning a visit to Vlorë.
