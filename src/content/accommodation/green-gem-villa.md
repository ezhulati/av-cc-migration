This villa doesn't just stop at basic amenities; it goes above and beyond with its inclusion of free WiFi, a flat-screen TV, and a washing machine, catering to all the comforts of home. The fully equipped kitchen, complete with a dishwasher, invites guests to prepare their meals while enjoying the panoramic sea views from the balcony, thoughtfully furnished with outdoor seating. Designed as a non-smoking haven, it promises a clean and fresh environment throughout the stay.

For those concerned about accessibility, Ioannina Airport is located 168 km away, making Green Gem Villa an accessible option for international travelers. This property stands out not just for its amenities but for its commitment to providing a tranquil and comfortable beachfront living experience.
