This non-smoking apartment boasts two well-appointed bedrooms, ensuring ample space and privacy for guests. The heart of the home, a fully equipped kitchen, invites guests to prepare their meals with ease, adding a touch of homeliness to the travel experience. For entertainment and relaxation, a flat-screen TV stands ready in the living area, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration.

For those traveling to or from the city by air, the convenience of being 150 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport cannot be overstated, making Joan's Apartment a smart choice for both short and extended stays in Vlorë.
