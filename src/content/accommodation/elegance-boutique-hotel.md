Inside, the attention to detail is evident. Rooms are not only equipped with a desk, catering to the needs of both leisure and business travelers, but also feature a flat-screen TV for entertainment at any time of the day. The inclusion of a private bathroom, complete with bed linen and towels, ensures a comfortable and hassle-free stay.

For those looking to explore, the Monastery Saint Naum is located an equal distance away, presenting an opportunity for a memorable day trip. Furthermore, the convenience of Kastoria National Airport being just 70 km away makes the Elegance Boutique Hotel an ideal choice for travelers seeking both comfort and accessibility in Korçë.
