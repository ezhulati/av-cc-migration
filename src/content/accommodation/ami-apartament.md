The apartment itself is generously sized, featuring two well-appointed bedrooms, a cozy living room, a kitchen equipped with everything needed for a home-cooked meal, and two modern bathrooms. Entertainment needs are met with the inclusion of a flat-screen TV, ensuring guests have a pleasant stay.

For those interested in exploring the local area, Independence Square is a mere 500 meters away, offering a glimpse into the city's vibrant life. Meanwhile, the historic Kuzum Baba stands 1.4 km from the apartment, inviting guests to explore its rich cultural significance. For international travelers, the convenience of Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport being just 149 km away makes AMI Apartment an attractive option for both short and long-term stays in Vlorë.
