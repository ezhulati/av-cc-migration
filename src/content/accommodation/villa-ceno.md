The apartment itself is generously sized, featuring a bedroom, a living room for relaxation, a fully equipped kitchen for those who love to cook, and a bathroom. Entertainment needs are met with a flat-screen TV, making it an ideal retreat for both short and long stays. Importantly, the space is committed to providing a smoke-free environment, catering to the comfort and health of all guests.

For those traveling to or from the capital, the convenience of being located 116 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport adds to Villa Ceno's appeal, making it a smart choice for both local and international visitors.
