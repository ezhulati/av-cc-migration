Dining at Hotel Marub is an experience in itself. The hotel's restaurant, complete with a summer terrace, prides itself on serving organic dishes prepared with locally sourced herbs and cheeses, complemented by a variety of hot and cold beverages and pure mountain spring water.

Hotel Marub's dedication to sustainability is evident in its use of solar panels, energy-saving insulation, and its practices in water conservation and recycling. Guests looking to explore the natural beauty of Northern Albania will find the hotel's location ideal. The front desk is more than willing to assist in organizing excursions to various destinations, offering opportunities for walking, hiking, and trekking in the surrounding areas.

Located approximately 2 km from State Road SH30, the hotel provides easy access to the Adriatic Sea and the town of Lezhë, both within 30 km, and the capital city of Tirana, just 70 km away. With free private parking available on site, Hotel Marub is not just a place to stay but a base for adventurers and eco-conscious travelers alike.
