Upon entering the air-conditioned premises, guests are greeted with a tastefully decorated living space that includes a bedroom, a living room, and a fully equipped kitchen boasting an oven and kettle for those moments when dining in feels just right. The bathroom, equipped with a bidet and complemented with slippers, adds a touch of home-comfort to the experience. The villa's soundproof rooms, featuring carpeted floors and a cozy fireplace, promise a serene retreat from the bustling world outside.

For those who prefer dining out, the villa's on-site restaurant serves a variety of meals ranging from dinner and lunch to brunch and high tea, catering to all tastes and preferences. Additionally, the convenience of bed linen, towels, and laundry service underscores the villa's commitment to guest comfort.

Travelers looking to explore beyond the villa's comforts will find the car rental service and airport transfers beneficial, especially considering the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 117 km away. Villa Kokoshi not only offers a stay but an experience steeped in history, comfort, and convenience, making it a must-visit destination for those traveling to Berat.
