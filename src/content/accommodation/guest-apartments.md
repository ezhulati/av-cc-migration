The apartment itself is a study in spacious living, featuring a well-appointed bedroom that promises restful nights. Entertainment is readily available through a TV equipped with streaming services, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration. Culinary enthusiasts will appreciate the fully equipped kitchen, boasting an oven and toaster for meal preparations, alongside a convenient washing machine. The inclusion of a bathroom with a bidet adds a touch of sophistication. Upon arrival, guests are welcomed through a private entrance into an abode that greets them with complimentary fruits, setting the tone for a stay marked by thoughtful hospitality.

For those inclined to venture beyond the beach, Skanderbeg Square offers a cultural excursion 47 km away, while the Rock of Kavaje, a mere 5.3 km from the apartment, presents a natural spectacle not to be missed. Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 41 km away, serves as the nearest gateway, making Guest Apartments an accessible retreat for both domestic and international travelers. This property not only promises a stay filled with relaxation and convenience but also positions itself as a gateway to the enchanting landscapes and rich history of the Golem region.
