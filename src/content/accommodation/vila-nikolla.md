Each room at Vila Nikolla is equipped with a flat-screen TV, ensuring entertainment and comfort are never compromised. Select accommodations boast balconies, providing guests with private spaces to enjoy the fresh air and perhaps a morning cup of coffee or an evening glass of wine.

For those interested in exploring the rich history and natural beauty of the area, Vila Nikolla serves as an ideal base. The Cave Church Archangel Michael and the Early Christian Basilica, both 40 km away, offer glimpses into the past, while the picturesque Port Ohrid and the Church of St. John at Kaneo, also 40 km from the guest house, present perfect day trip destinations.

Conveniently, Ohrid Airport is located just 47 km from Vila Nikolla, making it an accessible retreat for both domestic and international travelers seeking a peaceful getaway by the lake.
