Strategically positioned, Vila Afrimi is a mere 42 km away from the excitement of the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car and just a short 5.7 km drive from the natural beauty of the Rock of Kavaje. For those interested in exploring the rich history and culture of the area, the property is conveniently located 38 km from the iconic Skanderbeg Square and the same distance from the historical Former Residence of Enver Hoxha. Moreover, the ancient Durres Amphitheatre, a testament to the city's historical significance, is only 6.7 km away.

For travelers, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 32 km from the guest house, adds an extra layer of convenience, making Vila Afrimi an ideal choice for both leisure and business trips. The property's commitment to a non-smoking environment, coupled with its welcoming garden and terrace, ensures a comfortable and refreshing stay for all guests.
