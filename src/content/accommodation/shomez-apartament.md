This apartment doesn't just offer a place to stay; it provides a home away from home with its air-conditioned spaces featuring two separate bedrooms, a cozy living room, a fully equipped kitchen, and a modern bathroom. The inclusion of a flat-screen TV ensures that entertainment is always within reach.

Guests will appreciate the added perks of free private parking and complimentary WiFi, making their stay both hassle-free and connected. The non-smoking property also boasts a terrace, perfect for unwinding after a day of city exploration.

For those keen on shopping or exploring local landmarks, the proximity to Toptani Shopping Centre, Tanners' Bridge, and Clock Tower Tirana adds to the appeal. And with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport just 14 km away, Shomez Apartment offers both accessibility and a welcoming retreat in Albania's vibrant capital.
