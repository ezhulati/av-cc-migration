The apartment itself is a testament to modern living, boasting a cozy 1-bedroom layout. The living room, equipped with a flat-screen TV and streaming services, offers a homely ambiance for relaxation. A fully equipped kitchen stands ready for culinary adventures, while the bathroom comes with a hair dryer, adding a touch of convenience to personal care routines. The thoughtful addition of fruits as an in-room amenity further enhances the welcoming atmosphere.

For those incidental needs or quick snacks, the on-site minimarket proves incredibly handy. Cultural enthusiasts will appreciate the proximity to the Durres Amphitheatre, located just 4.7 km away, offering a glimpse into the rich history of the area. Additionally, the House of Leaves and Skanderbeg Square, both 38 km from the apartment, are accessible for those looking to delve into the country's past.

Completing the picture of accessibility, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is a mere 32 km away, ensuring smooth travel plans to and from the property. Ashley Home 1 stands out as a meticulously designed space that promises not just a stay, but an experience tailored for those who appreciate the finer details of travel accommodations.
