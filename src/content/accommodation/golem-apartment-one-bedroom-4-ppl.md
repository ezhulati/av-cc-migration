For those interested in exploring the local culture and history, the Rock of Kavaje is a mere 5.4 km away, while the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha offers a glimpse into Albania's past at 45 km from the doorstep. The apartment itself is a cozy retreat, featuring air conditioning for those warm Mediterranean days, a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a fully equipped kitchen for those who enjoy the comforts of home-cooked meals.

Further afield, Skanderbeg Square and the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car are both 45 km and 48 km away, respectively, offering guests the opportunity to explore the vibrant city life and stunning natural landscapes Albania has to offer. Conveniently, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is just 39 km away, making the Golem Apartment an accessible and attractive option for both domestic and international travelers seeking a blend of relaxation and adventure.
