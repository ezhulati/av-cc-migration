The villa itself is a spacious abode, thoughtfully designed to accommodate families or groups. It features three well-appointed bedrooms, two cozy living rooms for relaxation and socializing, and a balcony that presents serene garden views, perfect for morning coffees or evening reflections. Entertainment and connectivity are ensured with the inclusion of a flat-screen TV, while the fully equipped kitchen allows guests the freedom to prepare their meals just the way they like. Adding a touch of luxury, the villa houses three bathrooms, each with a hot tub, promising a relaxing end to a day of exploration.

For those looking to explore beyond the villa, Podgorica Airport is conveniently located 62 km away, making Arditi's Villa an ideal base for both local and international travelers seeking a peaceful escape with the promise of adventure nearby.
