The apartment itself is a haven of comfort, featuring air conditioning for those warm Mediterranean days. Guests will find themselves at home with a flat-screen TV for entertainment and a fully equipped kitchen, perfect for crafting local delicacies or a comforting meal. The addition of a balcony provides an intimate space to enjoy the fresh sea breeze and perhaps a morning coffee or an evening glass of wine.

Connectivity is never an issue, as guests can enjoy the convenience of free WiFi throughout their stay. It's noteworthy to mention that Odeon Residence is committed to providing a smoke-free environment, ensuring a clean and healthy stay for all guests.

For those venturing from afar, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is located 154 km away, making Odeon Residence an accessible retreat for both local and international visitors. This apartment not only promises a restful stay but also serves as a gateway to the enchanting city of Vlorë and its surrounding natural beauty.
