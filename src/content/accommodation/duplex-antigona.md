The apartment itself is a haven of modern living, featuring air conditioning for those warm Gjirokastër days. It is thoughtfully laid out with a cozy bedroom, a welcoming living room, and a kitchen that comes fully equipped with an oven and a coffee machine, catering to all culinary needs. The inclusion of a bathroom equipped with a shower and slippers adds a touch of home comfort, while the flat-screen TV ensures entertainment is always at hand. Unique to this accommodation is its private entrance, offering guests an unparalleled sense of privacy.

For travelers flying in, the convenience of Ioannina Airport being just 83 km away makes Duplex Antigona an ideal choice for both short and long stays, promising an experience that combines the comfort of modern amenities with the charm of Gjirokastër's rich history.
