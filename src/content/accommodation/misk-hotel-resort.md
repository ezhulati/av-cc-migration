Morning risers are greeted with a choice of breakfast options, ranging from a hearty buffet to à la carte and continental selections, ensuring a delightful start to the day. The on-site restaurant is a culinary haven, offering an array of dishes that span Mediterranean flavors, classic pizza, and authentic Turkish cuisine, with vegetarian, dairy-free, and halal preferences thoughtfully catered to.

For those who value seamless communication, the hotel's 24-hour front desk is staffed with multilingual professionals fluent in Arabic, German, English, and Russian, ready to assist with any inquiries or needs.

Explorers looking to venture beyond the hotel's comforts will find the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car 11 kilometers away, offering breathtaking views of the area, while the historical Former Residence of Enver Hoxha is a mere 7.4 kilometers from the hotel. For guests traveling by air, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is conveniently 16 kilometers away, with the hotel providing a paid shuttle service for a smooth transition to and from the property.

Misk Hotel & Resort stands out as a premier choice for those desiring a stay that combines the essence of Tirana's rich culture with the luxuries of modern hospitality.
