It houses a single bedroom, but what it lacks in quantity, it more than makes up for in quality. The living space is equipped with a flat-screen TV, complete with streaming services for entertainment at any time. The kitchen doesn’t disappoint either, being fully equipped with an oven, microwave, and even a washing machine, catering to all domestic needs. The inclusion of a bathroom with a bidet adds a touch of luxury, while complimentary wine or champagne and fruits await to delight guests upon arrival. Moreover, the commitment to a non-smoking and soundproof environment ensures that peace and cleanliness are paramount.

For those inclined to spend time outdoors, the garden offers a tranquil retreat. It's a perfect spot to unwind after a day of exploring the nearby attractions. SeaHana Apartment is conveniently located within easy reach of several popular beaches, including Spille Beach, Maracit Beach, and Prinos Beach, making it an ideal base for beach lovers. Despite its secluded feel, the property is relatively accessible, with Ioannina Airport situated 143 km away.

In summary, SeaHana Apartment stands out as a meticulously designed haven for guests seeking both relaxation and adventure in Himare. Its blend of modern comforts, strategic location, and thoughtful extras make it a compelling choice for discerning travelers.
