The attention to detail in the design of each apartment is evident. Guests are treated to a space that feels like home, yet is infused with the amenities of a high-end hotel. The living areas extend onto terraces that frame mountain landscapes, providing a picturesque backdrop for morning coffees or evening relaxation. Entertainment and convenience are at the forefront, with satellite flat-screen TVs and kitchens equipped with modern appliances, including a toaster, fridge, stovetop, coffee machine, and kettle. The inclusion of plush bed linen, towels, and private bathrooms with walk-in showers, slippers, and hair dryers adds a touch of luxury to the stay.

Beyond the confines of their apartments, guests are invited to unwind in the lush garden, a peaceful retreat from the bustling city life. The strategic location of Rustemi places it within easy reach of Saranda's main attractions. Saranda City Beach is a mere 1.9 km away, offering a vibrant beach scene, while the more secluded La Petite Beach lies 2.8 km from the property. For those looking to explore beyond the city, Ioannina Airport is 98 km away, making Rustemi an ideal base for both short and extended stays.

Rustemi stands out as a premier choice for travelers who value the blend of scenic beauty, privacy, and accessibility. Its thoughtful amenities and prime location make it a compelling choice for those looking to experience Sarandë in comfort and style.
