This 3-star establishment doesn't just rest on the laurels of its location; it goes above and beyond to provide a welcoming atmosphere, starting with a 24-hour front desk ready to cater to guests' needs at any hour. The allure of Villa HENA is further magnified by its accommodations. Each room is a haven of comfort, featuring air conditioning for those warm Mediterranean nights, a flat-screen TV with cable channels for entertainment, and a kitchen plus dining area for those who prefer a home-cooked meal even while away from home. Safety is also a priority, with each room equipped with a deposit box, ensuring peace of mind for all valuables.

The private bathrooms are equally impressive, boasting a bidet, hairdryer, and slippers to provide a spa-like experience in the privacy of one's room. The inclusion of a fridge in every room adds an extra layer of convenience, allowing guests to keep beverages and snacks chilled.

Perhaps one of the most captivating features of Villa HENA is the terrace available in each room, offering guests a unique vantage point to soak in the city's vibrant atmosphere.

For those looking to venture beyond the comforts of the hotel, Flamingo Beach is merely 2.4 km away, offering another picturesque spot for relaxation and leisure. Additionally, the historic Butrint National Park, located 12 km from the hotel, presents an opportunity for guests to immerse themselves in the rich cultural heritage of the region.

Situated 99 km from Ioannina Airport, Villa HENA also caters to the needs of international travelers, providing a serene base from which to explore the enchanting surroundings of Sarandë.
