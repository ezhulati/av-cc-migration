Spanning across a generous layout, Green Villa boasts three elegantly appointed bedrooms, a spacious living room complete with a flat-screen TV, and a fully equipped kitchen that caters to all culinary needs. The presence of two bathrooms equipped with showers, a hairdryer, and the added convenience of a washing machine ensures a comfortable stay for all guests. Air conditioning, a private entrance, and soundproofing are thoughtful touches that underscore the villa's commitment to guest comfort and privacy.

Outdoor enthusiasts will appreciate the villa's picnic area, a perfect setting for a day under the open sky.
