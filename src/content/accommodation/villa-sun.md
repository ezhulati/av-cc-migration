The villa itself is a testament to modern living, boasting air-conditioned spaces that encompass two cozy bedrooms, a welcoming living room, and a fully equipped kitchen complete with an oven and a coffee machine. The presence of two well-appointed bathrooms, each featuring a shower and a hairdryer, adds to the villa's appeal. Guests will particularly enjoy the patio, which serves as a charming outdoor dining area, perfect for those balmy evenings under the stars. The provision of bed linen, towels, and laundry service underscores the villa's commitment to convenience.

For those traveling with little ones, the availability of a baby safety gate is a thoughtful touch, ensuring peace of mind for parents. Additionally, the on-site minimarket is a boon for guests, offering easy access to essentials without the need to venture far.

Located just 3 km from the vibrant Golem Beach and within a reasonable distance of 49 km from the historic Skanderbeg Square, Villa Sun positions itself as an ideal base for exploring the local area. With Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport only 43 km away, the villa promises a hassle-free arrival and departure, making it a compelling choice for both short and extended stays.

In essence, Villa Sun is not just a place to stay; it's a gateway to a memorable vacation experience, where convenience meets comfort in a picturesque setting.
