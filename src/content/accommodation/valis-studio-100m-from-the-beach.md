The apartment itself is a testament to thoughtful hospitality, featuring a cozy bedroom, a well-appointed bathroom stocked with fresh bed linen and towels, and a living space that includes a flat-screen TV and a dining area. The fully equipped kitchen and the tranquil terrace with its quiet street views invite guests to create and enjoy their own meals in a peaceful setting. For those looking to celebrate or simply unwind, wine or champagne is available as part of the in-room amenities.

Convenience is further enhanced by the presence of a minimarket on the premises, making last-minute needs easily attainable. Situated just 200 meters from Vlore Beach, the studio offers easy access to the local coastline's beauty, with Ri Beach and Vjetër Beach each only a short 1.6 km journey away. For travelers venturing from afar, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is located 151 km from Valis Studio, making it a reachable destination for international and domestic visitors alike.

Valis Studio stands out as an ideal choice for those seeking a blend of beachside bliss and the comforts of home, all wrapped up in a location that's hard to beat.
