Boasting breathtaking mountain views, each accommodation invites guests onto its own balcony, where the beauty of Tushemisht can be soaked in from the comfort of your room. The commitment to a smoke-free environment underscores the property's dedication to providing a clean and healthy stay.

The highlight of Lake Harmony Haven is undoubtedly its spacious apartment, which features three well-appointed bedrooms. Entertainment is readily available through a flat-screen TV equipped with cable channels, while the fully equipped kitchen-complete with a dishwasher, oven, washing machine, microwave, and toaster-caters to every culinary need. The charm of the apartment is further enhanced by its parquet floors and a cozy fireplace, creating an atmosphere that is both inviting and tranquil. Additionally, an outdoor dining area offers the perfect setting for al fresco meals amidst the property's serene surroundings.

While its location offers a secluded feel, Lake Harmony Haven remains within accessible distance to notable landmarks, including the Early Christian Basilica, Port Ohrid, and the Church of St. John at Kaneo, all located approximately 35 km away. For those traveling by air, Ohrid Airport is 41 km from the property, making arrivals and departures a breeze.

Lake Harmony Haven stands out as an ideal choice for travelers in search of a tranquil getaway that does not compromise on the convenience of modern amenities and the proximity to cultural and natural attractions.
