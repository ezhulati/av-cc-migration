Guest accommodations at Noah's Home are meticulously appointed to ensure a restful stay. From the crisp air conditioning, functional desk, and sleek flat-screen TV to the pristine private bathroom stocked with fresh bed linen and towels, every detail has been considered. The highlight, however, is the terrace that accompanies each room, offering breathtaking views of the sea, designed to captivate and soothe in equal measure. The presence of a wardrobe in all units further adds to the convenience, ensuring guests can settle in and feel at home.

Strategically located, Noah's Home is just a leisurely stroll away from Potam Beach and within easy reach of Llamani Beach, making it an ideal base for beach enthusiasts. For those traveling from afar, Ioannina Airport is situated 142 km away, making the hotel accessible for both domestic and international guests seeking a tranquil escape by the sea.
