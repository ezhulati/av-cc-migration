The private bathrooms are notably designed with walk-in showers and complimentary slippers, adding a touch of home-comfort luxury. For guests inclined towards self-catering, select rooms boast fully equipped kitchens, complete with all necessary kitchenware. A desk in every unit ensures that both leisure and business travelers can find their needs met.

For those looking to venture further, the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car is located 42 km away, offering breathtaking views and an unforgettable experience. Meanwhile, the Rock of Kavaje, a mere 6.6 km from the property, presents an opportunity for exploration and adventure.

Convenience is further underscored by the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, just 32 km away, with Vogli's House providing a paid airport shuttle service for a seamless travel experience.
