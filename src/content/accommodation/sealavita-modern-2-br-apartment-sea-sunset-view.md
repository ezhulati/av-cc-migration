The apartment itself is a haven of comfort and style, boasting a spacious layout that includes two well-appointed bedrooms, a bathroom complete with all essentials like bed linen and towels, and a living area that merges seamlessly with a dining space. The highlight, however, is the fully equipped kitchen that opens up to a terrace, offering guests the unique opportunity to dine al fresco against a backdrop of stunning sea and mountain views. The addition of soundproofing and a private entrance ensures that privacy and tranquility are guaranteed.

For those looking to explore, the historical sites of Kuzum Baba and Independence Square are just a short drive away, adding a touch of culture to your beachside getaway. Despite its serene location, SeaLaVita is well-connected, with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport located 152 km away, making it an accessible retreat for both local and international visitors.

With its combination of modern amenities, exceptional location, and breathtaking views, SeaLaVita, Modern 2 BR Apartment Sea & Sunset View, is a standout choice for travelers seeking a memorable stay in Vlorë.
