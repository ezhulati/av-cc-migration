Each apartment at Brunas is thoughtfully designed with comfort in mind, featuring air conditioning for those warm Mediterranean days. Guests can expect to find a suite of modern amenities including a private bathroom, a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a fully equipped kitchen for those who enjoy preparing their own meals. Additionally, the inclusion of a terrace offers a private outdoor space to relax and unwind.

For beach enthusiasts, the location could not be more ideal. La Petite Beach and Maestral Beach are both within a 2 km radius, offering ample opportunities for sunbathing, swimming, and seaside relaxation. For those traveling from afar, Ioannina Airport is the nearest gateway, located 95 km from the apartments, making Brunas Apartments a convenient choice for both local and international travelers seeking a peaceful escape near Saranda's beautiful coastline.
