The living space is enhanced by a flat-screen TV with streaming services, a dining area for intimate meals, and a fully equipped kitchen for those who enjoy the art of cooking. Perhaps the jewel in its crown is the balcony, presenting breathtaking mountain views that promise to enchant guests from dawn till dusk.

For those looking to explore the wider area, a car rental service directly from the apartment adds an extra layer of convenience, ensuring that the best of Tirana and beyond is within easy reach. Noteworthy attractions close by include Rinia Park, Reja - The Cloud, and the Postbllok - Checkpoint Monument, each offering a unique glimpse into the city's cultural and historical landscape.

Accessibility is also a highlight, with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport located just 14 km away, making Miku Apartment a smart choice for both short and extended stays. Offering a serene retreat with its quiet street views, yet positioned within a stone's throw of the city's pulsating heart, this apartment is a testament to the allure of urban living combined with the comforts of home.
