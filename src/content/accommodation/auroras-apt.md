The apartment itself is a testament to modern comfort and tranquility, boasting a generous layout that includes two well-appointed bedrooms, a cozy living room, and a balcony that presents breathtaking sea views. Guests can expect a host of amenities designed to make their stay as comfortable as possible, including air conditioning, a flat-screen TV, and a fully equipped kitchen with an oven and fridge. The inclusion of a bathroom with a bidet adds a touch of luxury to the overall experience. Moreover, the property is committed to providing a serene environment, underscored by its non-smoking and soundproof rooms.

For those who relish outdoor dining, the apartment facilitates this with ease, allowing guests to savor their meals against the backdrop of the sea. Additionally, the convenience of having a bar on-site means that refreshing drinks are never far away.

Situated a considerable distance from the hustle and bustle, yet close enough to the heart of Vlorë, Aurora's Apartment is an ideal spot for those looking to enjoy the best of both worlds. With Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport located 152 km away, it serves as a comfortable and accessible retreat for both local and international travelers.
