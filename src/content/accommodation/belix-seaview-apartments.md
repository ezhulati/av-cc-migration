Each apartment boasts elegant parquet flooring and is equipped with a full kitchen, including a refrigerator, dining area, and essential cooking utensils, ensuring guests feel right at home. Entertainment is readily available through flat-screen TVs offering streaming services, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration. The convenience of a private bathroom with a walk-in shower and complimentary toiletries, alongside the provision of fresh bed linen and towels, adds to the comfort of the stay.

For those needing to pick up essentials or snacks, a minimarket on the premises offers the utmost convenience. While the allure of Durrës and its surroundings beckons, notable destinations such as Skanderbeg Square and the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car are within accessible distances, at 41 km and 45 km respectively. For guests arriving by air, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is a manageable 35 km away, with the option of a paid airport shuttle service provided by Belix Seaview Apartments for a hassle-free transfer.
