A mere 1.8 km from the historic Independence Square and 2.8 km from the iconic Kuzum Baba, guests find themselves enveloped in the rich tapestry of Vlorë's history and culture. Each apartment is designed with the modern family in mind, featuring spacious family rooms that merge comfort with functionality. The allure of the private balcony invites guests to bask in the garden views, while the convenience of a fully equipped kitchen, complete with an oven and toaster, ensures a home-away-from-home experience. The inclusion of a satellite flat-screen TV and a private bathroom with a bidet adds a touch of luxury to the stay.

Special attention has been given to create an allergen-free and soundproof environment, ensuring a peaceful and uninterrupted experience. The provision of bed linen and towels in each unit underscores the apartment complex's commitment to comfort and convenience.

For those venturing from afar, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport lies 150 km away, making Lion's Apartments Vlora an accessible retreat for both local and international travelers seeking the perfect blend of relaxation and exploration in Vlorë.
