The apartment itself is a haven of tranquility, boasting a well-appointed bedroom, a cozy living room, and a patio that opens up to refreshing garden views. Modern amenities are not spared, with a flat-screen TV, a fully equipped kitchen featuring an oven and a fridge, and a bathroom with a walk-in shower enhancing the living experience. The inclusion of towels and bed linen adds a touch of home. Notably, the apartment ensures guest privacy with a dedicated entrance.

For convenience, a minimarket on the property caters to guests' immediate needs, allowing for a worry-free stay. Additionally, the option to unwind in the garden presents a perfect opportunity to relax after a day of exploration.

With free WiFi and private parking, P-Apartment addresses the practical needs of today's traveler. Its proximity to Ioannina Airport, 97 km away, further adds to its appeal, making it a compelling choice for those visiting Sarandë.
