Guests are welcomed into a generously sized apartment that boasts two well-appointed bedrooms, a cozy living room, and a kitchen equipped with everything needed for a home-cooked meal. The inclusion of a flat-screen TV with cable channels ensures entertainment is always at hand. The highlight, however, is the access to a private balcony where one can enjoy the gentle sea breeze and the calming sound of waves.

For those looking to venture further, the mystical Kuzum Baba is just 3 km away, offering a glimpse into the local heritage. Moreover, the convenience of being 150 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport makes Saimir Apartments a compelling choice for both domestic and international travelers seeking a blend of comfort, convenience, and cultural immersion.
