The apartment, designed to cater to the needs of modern travelers, features two well-appointed bedrooms, ensuring ample space for guests. Entertainment and practicality are well balanced with the inclusion of a flat-screen TV and a fully equipped kitchen, complete with a dishwasher, an oven, and even a washing machine, making it an ideal home away from home. The provision of two bathrooms, each with a bidet, along with towels and bed linen, adds a layer of convenience and comfort to the stay. Moreover, the private entrance to the accommodation underscores a commitment to privacy and exclusivity.

For those moments of leisure or the need for a caffeine fix, the on-site coffee shop serves as a cozy retreat.

Ale Investa Hospitality's location is a strategic asset for explorers keen on immersing themselves in the local culture and history. It is a stone's throw away from notable landmarks such as Skanderbeg Square, the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, and the Postbllok - Checkpoint Monument, making it a convenient base for sightseeing. Additionally, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, merely 17 km away, coupled with the availability of airport transfers and car rental services, ensures seamless travel arrangements for guests.

In summary, Ale Investa Hospitality stands out as a sophisticated option for those visiting Tirana, offering a blend of comfort, convenience, and cultural proximity, making it an attractive choice for discerning travelers.
