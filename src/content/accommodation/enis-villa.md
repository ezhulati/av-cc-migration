The interior of Eni's Villa is a testament to thoughtful design and comfort. It houses three elegantly appointed bedrooms, two spacious living rooms, and a kitchen equipped with modern appliances including an oven and a kettle. The villa's two bathrooms are outfitted with walk-in showers and plush bathrobes, adding a touch of luxury to the experience. Whether it's enjoying a meal in the outdoor dining area or cozying up by the fireplace on a chilly evening, guests are invited to relax in style. The provision of bed linen, towels, and an ironing service further underscores the villa's commitment to guest comfort.

The villa's outdoor spaces are equally inviting, with a garden that offers a perfect setting for relaxation and contemplation.

For those looking to explore beyond the villa, the nearest airport, Tirana International Mother Teresa, is conveniently located just 42 km away. The villa also facilitates travel arrangements with a paid airport shuttle service, ensuring guests enjoy a hassle-free connection to their flights.

Eni's Villa stands out as a premier choice for travelers seeking a blend of modern amenities, comfort, and convenience in the heart of Lezhë.
