Boasting two well-appointed bedrooms, a bathroom stocked with essentials, and a living area that includes a flat-screen TV compatible with streaming services, the apartment ensures every stay is as comfortable as it is entertaining. The fully equipped kitchen and outdoor dining area invite guests to savor meals against a backdrop of sea views, while complimentary fruits, chocolates, or cookies add a personal touch to the warm welcome.
