This air-conditioned haven, boasting a balcony that offers breathtaking sea views, is a testament to modern living without sacrificing the warmth of home. The apartment is thoughtfully designed to cater to the needs of its guests, featuring two cozy bedrooms, a welcoming living room, and a flat-screen TV for entertainment. The kitchen does not disappoint, equipped with a dishwasher and an oven, ensuring that meal preparations are as breezy as the seaside air. The inclusion of a bathroom with a bidet, along with the provision of towels and bed linen, adds a layer of convenience to the stay.

Adding to the allure, the apartment offers a terrace that presents an opportunity to soak in the city views, making every moment spent there a memory to cherish. It's worth noting that the property maintains a non-smoking policy, ensuring a clean and fresh environment for all guests.

For those concerned about accessibility, the property is equipped with a lift, making it easy for everyone to navigate. While the nearest airport, Ioannina Airport, is 98 km away, the journey is a small price to pay for the tranquility and beauty that await at Sun Marine Apartment. This destination promises a blend of relaxation, adventure, and convenience, making it a compelling choice for travelers seeking a serene getaway with the comforts of modern living.
