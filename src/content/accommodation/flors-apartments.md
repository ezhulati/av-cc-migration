The charm of Flors Apartments is evident in each of its accommodations, where guests are treated to city views from private balconies, and in select units, the serene beauty of the sea from terraces or patios. The attention to detail is apparent in the provision of satellite flat-screen TVs, cozy seating areas, functional kitchenettes, and private bathrooms equipped with bidets, bathrobes, and slippers. Ensuring a home-like experience, all units are stocked with fresh bed linen and towels.

For those who prefer to stay in, a convenient minimarket on the premises caters to everyday needs, while the garden and bar offer perfect spots to unwind. The property is not just about relaxation; it encourages exploration and activity, especially with its proximity to cycling routes around Durrës. Families visiting Flors Apartments will appreciate the thoughtful addition of a baby safety gate, ensuring peace of mind during their stay.

Located a considerable distance from Skanderbeg Square (39 km) and Dajti Ekspres Cable Car (43 km), the property provides a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle, yet remains within reachable distance for day trips. For international travelers, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is conveniently 33 km away, making Flors Apartments a compelling choice for those seeking a blend of beachfront bliss and accessibility in Durrës.
