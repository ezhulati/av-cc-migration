The apartment itself is a testament to modern living, boasting a terrace that overlooks a tranquil inner courtyard. Guests will find a cozy bedroom, a welcoming living room equipped with a flat-screen TV, and a kitchen that comes fully equipped with a microwave and fridge. The convenience of an in-apartment bathroom featuring a bidet, along with the provision of towels and bed linen, underscores the property's attention to detail. Importantly, Buddha 621 maintains a non-smoking environment, ensuring a pleasant stay for all guests.

For those looking to explore beyond the local beaches, Skanderbeg Square and the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car lie within reachable distances, offering unique experiences and breathtaking views. The nearest airport, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, is located 36 km away, making Buddha 621 an accessible haven for both domestic and international travelers.
