This air-conditioned haven boasts two well-appointed bedrooms, a fully equipped kitchenette for those home-cooked meals, and a bathroom designed with simplicity and functionality in mind. Entertainment is readily available through the inclusion of a flat-screen TV, ensuring guests have all the comforts of home at their fingertips.

Strategically located, the apartment is a mere 7.2 km from the iconic Rock of Kavaje and just over 4 km from the ancient Durres Amphitheatre, inviting guests to explore the rich history and cultural heritage of the area. Despite its proximity to these landmarks, the property maintains a tranquil atmosphere as it is a strictly non-smoking establishment.

For those interested in Albania's complex history, the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha is 38 km away, offering a glimpse into the country's past. Additionally, the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, located 42 km from the apartment, provides an opportunity for an unforgettable aerial view of the region.

Cultural enthusiasts will appreciate the proximity to the House of Leaves and Rinia Park, both situated 37 km away, offering insights into Albania's vibrant culture and history. Lastly, the convenience of being just 32 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport makes Apartment by the Beach an ideal lodging choice for both domestic and international travelers looking for a hassle-free stay in Durrës.
