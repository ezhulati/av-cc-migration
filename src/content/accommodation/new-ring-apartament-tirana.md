The apartment itself is a testament to modern living, boasting air-conditioned spaces that promise a cool retreat from Tirana's bustling streets. Guests will find themselves enveloped in the comfort of a spacious layout that includes a balcony, a cozy bedroom, and a living room designed for relaxation. The kitchen does not disappoint, coming well-equipped with a fridge and essentials for those who prefer to whip up their own meals.

Entertainment is readily available with a flat-screen TV equipped with cable channels, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration. For those keen on delving into Albania's rich history, the apartment is conveniently located just 5.4 km from the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, offering a unique glimpse into the country's past.

Further afield, the adventurous can venture to the Rock of Kavaje, located 41 km away, or explore the House of Leaves, a mere 3.8 km from the apartment. For guests arriving by air, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is an accessible 12 km journey, making New Ring Apartament Tirana an ideal base for both short and extended stays in Tirana.
