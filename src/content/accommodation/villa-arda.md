The villa itself is a testament to thoughtful accommodation, featuring an air-conditioned space with a separate bedroom, a living room designed for relaxation, and a bathroom equipped with a hairdryer and complimentary toiletries. Attention to detail is evident in the provision of towels and bed linen, ensuring a comfortable and hassle-free stay. The villa's commitment to privacy and security is underscored by its private entrance and round-the-clock security measures.

Located a mere 2.8 km from the picturesque Golem Beach, Villa Arda also offers easy access to the cultural heartbeat of the region, with Skanderbeg Square located 49 km away, and the Rock of Kavaje just 7.6 km from the doorstep. For those arriving by air, the convenience of a paid airport shuttle service from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, situated 43 km away, adds to the seamless experience of staying at Villa Arda. This property not only promises a memorable stay but also delivers a perfect blend of tranquility, security, and accessibility.
