The apartment itself is a study in spacious living, featuring a bedroom that promises restful nights. Entertainment is readily available with a flat-screen TV boasting an array of cable channels, while the fully equipped kitchen caters to every culinary need. From an oven and microwave to a washing machine, fridge, and stovetop, guests have everything required to create a home-cooked meal away from home. The provision of towels and bed linen adds a touch of convenience, ensuring a comfortable stay.

Adding to the allure, Fancy Apartment offers a unique blend of privacy and accessibility with its private entrance, allowing guests to come and go as they please. The location is unbeatable for those eager to explore, with the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, House of Leaves, and Rinia Park all within close proximity. For those traveling further afield, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is just 15 km away, making Fancy Apartment an ideal base for both short and extended stays in Tirana.
