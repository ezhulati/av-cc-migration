The property prides itself on being a smoke-free environment, ensuring a clean and healthy stay for all guests. The holiday home itself is a haven of comfort, featuring air conditioning for those warm summer days, two cozy bedrooms for restful nights, and a flat-screen TV for entertainment at any time. The fully equipped kitchen stands ready for culinary adventures, whether it's a quick breakfast or a full dinner feast.

For those looking to enjoy the outdoors, House 28 doesn't disappoint. The garden invites guests to relax and unwind, while the barbecue facilities are perfect for hosting memorable meals under the sky.

For explorers eager to venture further, Independence Square awaits at a distance of 18 km, offering a glimpse into the region's vibrant history and culture. And when it's time to say goodbye, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is 167 km away, making departures as smooth as the arrival.
