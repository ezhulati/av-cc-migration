The apartment itself is a study in spaciousness and comfort, featuring two well-appointed bedrooms, a cozy living room equipped with a flat-screen TV for entertainment, a fully equipped kitchen for those who prefer to prepare their own meals, and a bathroom that provides the choice of a bath or shower. An added convenience is the dressing room, allowing guests to comfortably prepare for their day out or a relaxing evening in.

For moments of tranquility, the property boasts a garden where guests can unwind and soak in the peaceful atmosphere.

Beyond the comforts of the apartment, the location serves as an ideal base for exploring. Ylberi Beach is just a short 1.7 km journey away, offering another beautiful spot for relaxation and sunbathing. For those interested in historical exploration, Rozafa Castle Shkodra awaits at a distance of 42 km, promising a fascinating day trip. Furthermore, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 49 km away, adds to the convenience for international travelers.

Shengjin-mi casa es tu casa presents an inviting option for those in search of a blend of comfort, convenience, and the charm of Shëngjin's coastal beauty.
