Each apartment at Mucaj House is thoughtfully designed to cater to the needs of families and groups, featuring a fully equipped kitchen, a dining area for communal meals, and a cozy living space with a flat-screen TV offering a variety of streaming services. The attention to detail extends to the private bathrooms, where guests can unwind in a bath, enveloped in the luxury of soft bathrobes and slippers, with bed linen and towels thoughtfully provided.

For those needing essentials or a quick snack, the convenience of an on-site minimarket adds to the appeal of staying at Mucaj House. The property's location also places guests within a short drive from notable landmarks such as Independence Square and Kuzum Baba, making it an excellent base for exploring the rich cultural tapestry of Vlorë.

For international travelers, the reassurance of a paid airport shuttle service to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 151 km away, ensures a seamless travel experience to and from Mucaj House. This apartment complex not only promises a stay marked by comfort and convenience but also serves as a gateway to the enchanting surroundings of Vlorë.
