Each apartment within this complex is thoughtfully designed to cater to families, featuring air conditioning for those warm summer days, a cozy seating area perfect for unwinding, and a flat-screen TV with cable channels for entertainment. The inclusion of a fully equipped kitchen and dining area allows guests the freedom to prepare their own meals, adding a touch of home. Privacy and comfort are ensured with a private bathroom equipped with a bidet, and the personal touch of a private entrance to each unit. To further enhance the stay, bed linen and towels are meticulously provided in all units.

For those looking to explore beyond the immediate comforts of Amar, Qerret Beach offers a serene escape just 2.7 km away, while the historic Skanderbeg Square in the heart of the capital is a 46 km journey worth taking. Conveniently, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is located 40 km from the property, making Amar an accessible retreat for both local and international travelers.

Amar emerges as a top recommendation for those in search of a blend of home-like amenities and the ease of access to beautiful beaches and local attractions.
