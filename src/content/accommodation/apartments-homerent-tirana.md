The highlight of this property is undoubtedly its spacious apartments, which feature a balcony that presents breathtaking mountain views. Each apartment is thoughtfully designed with a separate bedroom, a cozy living room equipped with a flat-screen TV, and a fully equipped kitchen that includes a dishwasher and an oven. The inclusion of a walk-in shower in the bathroom, along with the provision of towels and bed linen, adds a touch of comfort and convenience. Moreover, the added benefit of a private entrance ensures that guests enjoy an undisturbed and private stay.

For those who might need to pick up essentials or snacks without venturing far, a minimarket on the premises serves as a handy resource. Additionally, the availability of a car rental service directly from the apartment facilitates easy exploration of Tirana and its surroundings.
