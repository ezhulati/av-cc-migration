Each apartment is thoughtfully equipped with a kitchen and a private bathroom, catering to the needs of families and groups looking for a home away from home. The addition of free WiFi, a washing machine, and a flat-screen TV with satellite channels in every unit ensures that guests have all the modern amenities at their fingertips.

For those flying in, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is conveniently situated just 43 km away, making Mili Apartments an accessible retreat for both domestic and international visitors.
