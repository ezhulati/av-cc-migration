Each apartment at Bellavista is a testament to elegance, equipped with air conditioning, LCD satellite TV, and a kitchen that meets all culinary needs. The attention to detail extends to the private bathrooms, which come with either a bath or shower, and the provision of towels and bed linen adds a touch of home.

While the swimming pool invites guests for a refreshing dip at a small additional cost, the availability of sun beds and beach umbrellas ensures relaxation is never far away. For those looking to explore, a brief stroll leads to a supermarket and a selection of restaurants offering both traditional Albanian flavors and international cuisine.

The adventurous at heart will appreciate the proximity to Lekursi Castle, offering panoramic views of Sarandë from its mountain perch, and the historic allure of the seven nearby churches. For a deeper dive into history, the UNESCO-protected Butrint is accessible with just a 20-minute bus ride.

Conveniently, a bus stop is located a mere 25 meters from Bellavista Apartments, making exploration of the surrounding area both easy and inviting. This property not only serves as a comfortable base but also as a gateway to the rich cultural and historical tapestry of Sarandë.
