Positioned just a short 500-meter stroll from the inviting sands of Shëngjin Beach, this property stands out for its commitment to a smoke-free environment, promising a clean and healthy stay for all. The apartment itself is a study in efficiency and comfort, featuring a single bedroom, a fully equipped kitchen for those who love to prepare their meals, and a bathroom designed with simplicity and functionality in mind. Entertainment needs are not overlooked, with a flat-screen TV available for guests' enjoyment.

For those looking to explore beyond the immediate comforts of their accommodation, Ylberi Beach offers its serene shores just 1.2 km away, while the historic Rozafa Castle Shkodra awaits 41 km from the apartment, inviting cultural excursions and exploration. Furthermore, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 48 km away, ensures that arrivals and departures are as stress-free as possible.

Edi's Shengjin Apartment not only provides a base for beach lovers and cultural explorers alike but also stands as a testament to thoughtful accommodation that prioritizes guest comfort and convenience.
