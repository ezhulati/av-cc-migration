The property boasts two well-appointed bedrooms and a bathroom, complete with all the necessary linens and towels. The living space is enhanced by a flat-screen TV equipped with streaming services, a dining area ready for memorable meals, and a fully stocked kitchen for those who love to cook. Perhaps the most enchanting feature is the terrace, offering serene garden views - an ideal backdrop for both relaxation and outdoor dining. The added benefit of a private entrance ensures that guests enjoy their stay with an extra layer of privacy.

For those minor necessities or quick snacks, a minimarket on the premises caters to guests' needs without the need to venture far. The garden invites visitors to unwind and soak in the tranquility of their surroundings, making it a perfect spot for leisurely afternoons.

E&E Home Sweet Home is not just about the comfort it offers within its walls but also about its prime location. It is a stone's throw away from the Toptani Shopping Centre, the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet of Albania, and the National Gallery of Arts Tirana, making it an ideal base for exploring the cultural richness of the city. For guests arriving by air, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is conveniently located 15 km away, ensuring easy access to and from this charming holiday home.
