The apartment itself is a haven of space and comfort, featuring two well-appointed bedrooms, a fully equipped kitchen complete with an oven and microwave, and a cozy seating area perfect for unwinding. Entertainment needs are met with a flat-screen TV, and the convenience of a bathroom equipped with a bidet adds to the overall appeal. Additionally, guests have access to laundry services, ensuring a hassle-free stay.

For those looking to explore beyond the comfort of Family Residence, Ylberi Beach is within easy reach, located just 1.8 km away. The historic Rozafa Castle Shkodra, a must-visit landmark, is 42 km from the apartment, offering a glimpse into the rich cultural tapestry of the region. Furthermore, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, just 49 km away, makes Family Residence an ideal base for both short and extended stays in Shëngjin.
