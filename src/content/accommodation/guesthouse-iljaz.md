The holiday home itself is a testament to thoughtful accommodation, featuring a spacious terrace that presents breathtaking mountain views. Inside, the residence boasts two well-appointed bedrooms, a cozy living room equipped with a satellite flat-screen TV, an equipped kitchen for those who love to cook, and two bathrooms complete with a walk-in shower and bidet. The highlight for many, however, is the opportunity to dine al fresco in the outdoor dining area, where meals are enjoyed against the backdrop of stunning river views. Importantly, the entire premises are designated as non-smoking, ensuring a clean and fresh environment for all guests.

For families, the inclusion of a kids pool adds a touch of fun, ensuring that younger guests are entertained, while adults may find solace in the lush garden, a perfect spot for relaxation.

Situated 115 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, Guesthouse Iljaz presents itself as an ideal choice for travelers seeking a blend of relaxation and adventure in Berat. Whether it's the convenience of a shuttle service, the freedom of a car rental option, or simply the allure of a holiday home that feels like a private escape, this property caters to a wide range of needs and preferences.
