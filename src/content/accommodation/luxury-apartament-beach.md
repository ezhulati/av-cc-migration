The apartment itself is a study in comfort and convenience, boasting a bedroom, a bathroom, and a living space that merges functionality with elegance. Guests will find themselves enveloped in the comfort of high-quality bed linen and towels, while entertainment options are plentiful thanks to a flat-screen TV equipped with streaming services. The dining area provides a cozy spot for meals, and the fully equipped kitchen allows for the easy preparation of both snacks and full dinners. Perhaps the crown jewel of the apartment is its balcony, offering unobstructed sea views that promise to enchant every morning.

Designed with the modern traveler in mind, the air-conditioned unit includes thoughtful amenities such as a bidet and a dressing room, ensuring a stay that is as comfortable as it is luxurious. Moreover, the apartment prides itself on being allergy-free and strictly non-smoking, catering to the health and well-being of all guests.

For those seeking moments of tranquility, the property's garden offers a serene retreat where one can unwind and soak in the natural beauty of the surroundings.

Located just 1.9 km from the bustling Durres Beach and a scenic drive from Skanderbeg Square, Luxury Apartment Beach serves as an ideal base for exploring the rich cultural tapestry of the area. With Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport only 38 km away, guests will find both arrival and departure to be conveniently hassle-free.
