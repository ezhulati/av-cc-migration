The presence of two bathrooms, each equipped with a bidet, along with the provision of towels and bed linen, underscores the apartment's commitment to convenience and comfort.

In addition to its inviting interiors, the apartment ensures a worry-free stay with around-the-clock front desk service, full-day security, and even a currency exchange facility for international guests.
