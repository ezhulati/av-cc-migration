The kitchen is fully equipped, catering to guests' culinary needs, whether they're whipping up a quick breakfast or a full meal. The added benefit of a private entrance enhances the sense of exclusivity and privacy.

Located a considerable distance from the hustle and bustle, the property is 118 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, making it a peaceful retreat yet reasonably accessible for international travelers.
