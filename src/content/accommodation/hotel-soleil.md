Each guest room is a haven of relaxation, equipped with a private bathroom that includes a bidet and hairdryer for convenience. The modern comforts of a flat-screen TV and air conditioning are standard, with select rooms enhancing the stay experience further with the addition of a balcony. A minibar in the units ensures refreshments are always within reach.

The hotel's prime location places it merely 400 meters from the vibrant Folie Marine Beach and just over a kilometer from the serene Akuariumit Beach, making it an ideal base for beach enthusiasts. For those traveling from afar, Ioannina Airport is located 150 km away, making Hotel Soleil an accessible retreat for both domestic and international guests seeking a blend of relaxation and adventure by the sea.
