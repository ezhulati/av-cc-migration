The inclusion of bed linen and towels ensures a hassle-free stay, while the flat-screen TV and free WiFi cater to both entertainment and connectivity needs. The heart of this apartment is undoubtedly its fully equipped kitchen, paired with a dining area that invites families to create and share meals together. Perhaps the most captivating feature, however, is the balcony that offers unobstructed sea views, promising tranquil mornings and picturesque sunsets.

Attention to detail is evident in the thoughtful design of the apartment, which includes a private entrance for those who value discretion and soundproofing to ensure restful nights. Located 97 km from Ioannina Airport, Sea View Family Apartment is not just a place to stay but a gateway to exploring the beauty and history of Sarandë and its surroundings.
