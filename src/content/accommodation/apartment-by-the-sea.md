The apartment itself is a haven of modern living, boasting air conditioning for those warm summer days, two cozy bedrooms, and a living area equipped with a satellite flat-screen TV for entertainment. The dining area and a fully equipped kitchen, including a fridge, allow guests the freedom to prepare their meals just the way they like. It's worth noting that the entire property is a smoke-free zone, ensuring a clean and fresh environment for all guests.

Connectivity is never an issue, as free WiFi is available throughout the premises. For those arriving by car, private parking is available for a nominal fee, adding an extra layer of convenience. Additionally, the property features an elevator and an ATM, catering to all the practical needs of its guests.

For those who enjoy a good cup of coffee or need a meal on the go, the apartment's coffee shop and packed lunch options are perfect. Families will appreciate the thoughtful inclusion of outdoor play equipment and a baby safety gate, making it a child-friendly option. Moreover, the availability of a car rental service and the proximity to cycling-friendly areas ensure that exploration is always on the agenda.

Situated 42 km from the historic Rozafa Castle Shkodra and 44 km from the serene Lake Skadar, the apartment serves as an ideal base for those looking to explore the region's rich cultural and natural heritage.
