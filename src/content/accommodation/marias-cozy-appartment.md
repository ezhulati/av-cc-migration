It boasts a well-appointed bedroom, a living space equipped with a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a fully equipped kitchen. The kitchen is a highlight for those who prefer the comforts of home-cooked meals while traveling, featuring a dishwasher, oven, washing machine, fridge, and stovetop. Additionally, the provision of a private entrance enhances the sense of privacy and exclusivity for guests.

Located just 2.4 km from the bustling Skanderbeg Square, the apartment serves as a peaceful haven away from the city's hustle and bustle, yet close enough to dive back into urban adventures at a moment's notice. For those looking to explore beyond the city, the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car is a mere 7.1 km away, offering breathtaking views and a unique perspective of the area.

Further afield, the Rock of Kavaje stands 42 km away, presenting an opportunity for a scenic day trip. Meanwhile, the Pyramid of Tirana is conveniently situated just 2.1 km from the apartment, allowing for easy access to one of the city's most iconic landmarks.
