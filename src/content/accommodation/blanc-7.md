The apartment itself is a testament to modern living, boasting air-conditioned spaces throughout, including a generous balcony that invites guests to enjoy their own private outdoor retreat. The layout is thoughtfully designed, featuring three well-appointed bedrooms, a cozy living room for relaxation, a fully equipped kitchen for those who love to cook, and two bathrooms, ensuring ample space and privacy for all guests. Entertainment needs are well catered to with the inclusion of a flat-screen TV, making it easy for guests to unwind after a day of exploring the city.

BLANC 7's location is particularly noteworthy, placing guests in close proximity to several of Tirana's most sought-after attractions. The Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet of Albania, and the National Museum of History Albania are all within easy reach, making it an ideal base for those keen to delve into the rich cultural tapestry of the city. For those traveling further afield, the convenience of being just 14 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport adds to the appeal of BLANC 7 as a top-tier accommodation choice in Tirana.
