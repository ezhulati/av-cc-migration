The apartment itself is a haven of modern amenities and comfort. With two well-appointed bedrooms, a sleek flat-screen TV, and a spacious dining area, guests are guaranteed a stay that combines luxury with the comforts of home. The fully equipped kitchen, complete with an oven, invites those with a culinary flair to whip up their favorite dishes, while the living room provides a cozy retreat after a day of exploration.

Perhaps the most captivating feature is the apartment's outdoor dining area, where guests can dine al fresco against the backdrop of breathtaking sea views. It's an experience that elevates every meal into a memorable event.

For those looking to explore beyond the apartment, a car rental service on-site makes it easy to venture out. The surrounding area is a playground for adventure seekers, with diving and fishing opportunities readily available for an unforgettable experience close to nature.

Noteworthy nearby attractions include the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, offering panoramic views from a unique perspective, and the historical Rock of Kavaje, both within a reasonable distance. Additionally, the property is conveniently located 34 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, making it an accessible choice for international travelers.

In summary, the Sea View Apartment is not just a place to stay but a gateway to experiencing the best of Durrës, combining the convenience of city living with the serene beauty of beachfront accommodation.
