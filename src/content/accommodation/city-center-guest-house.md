Guests can enjoy the modern comforts of air-conditioned rooms, each equipped with a flat-screen TV, ensuring a relaxing stay. The thoughtful addition of a private entrance to the accommodations enhances the sense of privacy and exclusivity.

Connectivity is seamless, with free WiFi available throughout the premises, making it easy for guests to stay in touch with loved ones or manage work commitments. For those venturing from afar, the proximity to Ioannina Airport, located 97 kilometers away, underscores the guest house's appeal to international travelers.

City Center Guest House thus presents itself as an ideal lodging option, combining the convenience of city living with the tranquility and privacy valued by discerning guests.
