The apartment itself is a haven of space and luxury, featuring a bedroom that promises restful nights, a living area with a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a balcony that presents awe-inspiring sea views. The inclusion of outdoor furniture on the balcony ensures that guests can comfortably soak in the vistas or enjoy a meal under the sky. For those who love to cook, the fully equipped kitchen with its dishwasher, oven, washing machine, toaster, and fridge adds a touch of home-away-from-home convenience.

Connectivity is never an issue, as free WiFi is available throughout the property, ensuring that guests can stay connected with the world or share their memorable moments instantly. The soundproofing of the accommodation guarantees that the only sounds to fill the rooms are those of laughter and joy, not the hustle and bustle from outside.

For dining and leisure, the property doesn't disappoint. A restaurant on the premises offers delightful culinary experiences, while the on-site bar serves as a cozy spot for evening drinks. Those looking to explore Sarandë will find that the apartment is perfectly positioned for engaging in activities such as hiking, with Maestral Beach and the historic Butrint National Park only a short distance away.

Holiday Apartment Alma is not just a place to stay; it's a gateway to experiencing the vibrant life and natural beauty of Sarandë, making it an ideal choice for travelers seeking both adventure and tranquility. With Ioannina Airport 97 km away, the journey to this coastal retreat is an easy transition to a holiday filled with relaxation and exploration.
