Spanning a generous layout, the apartment is thoughtfully appointed with a bedroom, a bathroom, and comes complete with all the essentials such as bed linen and towels. The living space is enhanced by a flat-screen TV and a dining area, perfect for leisurely meals. The heart of the home, a fully equipped kitchen, invites guests to prepare their own gourmet meals. Perhaps the crown jewel of this accommodation is the balcony, presenting breathtaking sea views that promise to captivate any visitor.

Beyond the confines of the apartment, guests can enjoy pool views that add an extra layer of relaxation to their stay. For those looking to explore, Independence Square is just 7.6 km away, offering a glimpse into the local culture and history.

Situated 157 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, Magic View represents an ideal choice for travelers seeking a blend of comfort, convenience, and the beauty of the Albanian coastline.
