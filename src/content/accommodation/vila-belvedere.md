The hotel's interior pays homage to traditional Italian elegance, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. Each guest room is thoughtfully appointed with modern amenities including air conditioning, satellite TV, a minibar, and a private bathroom, ensuring a stay that combines comfort with convenience.

Just a brief stroll of 100 meters brings guests to the nearest beach, where the Adriatic Sea's gentle waves offer a tranquil escape. For those intrigued by history, the Durres Amphitheatre, noted as the largest Roman amphitheatre in the Balkans, awaits exploration in the city center. Additionally, the convenience of being only 35 km from Tirana Airport makes Vila Belvedere an ideal choice for both leisure and business travelers seeking a serene retreat with easy access to local attractions.
