This generously sized apartment boasts a modern living space complete with a bedroom, a flat-screen TV featuring a wide array of cable channels, and a kitchen outfitted with all the essentials, including a dishwasher, fridge, and washing machine. The provision of towels and bed linen adds a touch of home comfort to the stay.

Families traveling with little ones will appreciate the thoughtful addition of a baby safety gate, ensuring a worry-free stay for parents.

For those venturing from afar, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is located 150 km from the property, making Dior Apartment Vlore an accessible retreat for both local and international guests.
