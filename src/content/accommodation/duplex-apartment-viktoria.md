The apartment itself is a study in comfort and privacy, boasting air conditioning for those warm summer days, a separate bedroom for uninterrupted rest, and a cozy living area perfect for unwinding. Guests will appreciate the added touches of a flat-screen TV and a private entrance, ensuring a stay that combines entertainment with exclusivity.

For those concerned about travel logistics, the proximity to Ioannina Airport, just 83 km away, makes Duplex Apartment Viktoria a convenient base for exploring the region or for those in transit. The inclusion of a terrace invites guests to enjoy their morning coffee or evening relaxation outdoors, adding an extra layer of enjoyment to their stay.
