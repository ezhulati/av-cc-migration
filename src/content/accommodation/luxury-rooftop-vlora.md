Guests are welcomed into a spacious haven that boasts a terrace offering panoramic sea vistas. The apartment is thoughtfully designed with three bedrooms, a cozy living room equipped with a flat-screen TV, and a fully equipped kitchen that includes a dishwasher and an oven, ensuring a home-away-from-home experience. The convenience of two bathrooms with walk-in showers adds to the comfort, while the air-conditioned unit's hot tub and dressing room elevate the sense of luxury.

The property doesn't just stop at providing a comfortable stay; it extends its hospitality by offering a 24-hour front desk, airport transfers, full-day security, and complimentary WiFi, ensuring peace of mind throughout the stay. An outdoor dining area invites guests to enjoy meals under the sky, while the presence of a minimarket within the apartment complex adds an extra layer of convenience.

For those keen on exploring the local area, sightseeing tours can be arranged, promising an immersive experience. The apartment also features an outdoor fireplace and a picnic area, perfect for those looking to unwind in the tranquility of their temporary home.

Located 2.9 km from Independence Square and a bit further from Kuzum Baba, Luxury Rooftop Vlora offers an ideal base for exploring the rich cultural tapestry of the area. With Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport 151 km away, the journey to this exquisite retreat is a small price to pay for the unparalleled experience that awaits.
