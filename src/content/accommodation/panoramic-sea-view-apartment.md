Attention to detail is evident in the apartment's design, offering a private entrance and soundproofing to ensure a peaceful stay. Situated a short drive from the enchanting Butrint National Park and within proximity to VIP Beach, guests have the luxury of exploring the natural beauty and historical richness of the area. With Ioannina Airport located 96 km away, the apartment also caters to those traveling from afar, making it an accessible escape to the picturesque coast of Sarandë.
