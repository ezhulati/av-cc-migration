The accommodation itself is a testament to modern living, boasting a spacious bedroom, a cozy living room equipped with a flat-screen TV, and a fully equipped kitchen that includes a dishwasher and an oven. The highlight, however, is the terrace that offers breathtaking mountain views, providing an ideal backdrop for meals in the outdoor dining area, with the added bonus of river views that promise to enchant every guest. The apartment ensures a smoke-free environment, catering to the comfort and well-being of all guests.

For travelers concerned with accessibility, Podgorica Airport is conveniently located just 61 km away, making Gjovi Apartment an accessible haven for both short and long-term stays. This property does not just offer a place to stay; it promises an experience that combines the comforts of home with the beauty of Shkodër.
