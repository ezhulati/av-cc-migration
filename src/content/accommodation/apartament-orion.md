The apartment itself is a testament to thoughtful design and comfort, featuring a generous layout that includes a bedroom, a living area equipped with a flat-screen TV, and a balcony that presents breathtaking mountain views. The kitchen is well-appointed with modern appliances such as an oven and a fridge, catering to guests' culinary needs. The convenience of a private bathroom equipped with a bidet, alongside the luxury of air conditioning, enhances the living experience. Notably, the apartment offers the exclusivity of a private entrance, elevating the sense of privacy and tranquility for guests.

Situated merely 2.3 km from the serene Vjetër Beach and within proximity to the intriguing Kuzum Baba, Apartament Orion positions itself as an ideal base for exploring the rich cultural tapestry and natural beauty of Vlorë. For those traveling from afar, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is located 149 km away, making the apartment accessible for international visitors seeking to discover the charm of this coastal city.
