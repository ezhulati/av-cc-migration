The apartment itself is a study in modern living, featuring a single bedroom and bathroom, but not skimping on amenities. Guests will find everything needed for a comfortable stay, including bed linen, towels, a flat-screen TV with satellite channels for entertainment, and a fully equipped kitchen for those who prefer to dine in. The addition of a terrace offering sea views elevates the experience, allowing guests to enjoy their meals with a view. The air-conditioned unit also boasts a bidet and a dressing room, ensuring convenience and privacy.

For those who might need to pick up essentials or snacks, a minimarket on the premises adds an extra layer of convenience. While the allure of the beach is undeniable, the apartment's location also makes it a perfect base for exploring further afield. The Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, offering breathtaking views of the area, is 42 km away, and the intriguing Rock of Kavaje is just 6.4 km from the apartment. For guests arriving by air, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is a manageable 33 km away, making Luxury Seaside Apartment an accessible choice for both domestic and international travelers.

In summary, Luxury Seaside Apartment offers a harmonious blend of location, comfort, and amenities, making it an attractive option for those looking to enjoy the beauty and culture of Durres Beach and its surroundings.
