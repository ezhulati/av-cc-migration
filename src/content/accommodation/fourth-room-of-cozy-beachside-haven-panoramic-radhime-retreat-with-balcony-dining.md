The holiday home is a testament to thoughtful design, featuring an air-conditioned bedroom that promises restful nights. The presence of a fully equipped kitchenette adds a touch of home, allowing guests to prepare their meals with ease. The inclusion of towels and bed linen ensures a comfortable stay, while the outdoor dining area invites guests to savor their meals against the backdrop of the sea.

Perched directly on the beach, the property affords guests unparalleled views of the sea from its inviting balcony, making it an ideal spot for morning coffees or evening reflections. Despite its tranquil location, the retreat remains within easy reach of local attractions, with Kevi Beach just 1.7 km away and the historic Kuzum Baba and Independence Square both 13 km from the doorstep.

For those venturing from afar, the nearest gateway is Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 162 km away, making Fourth Room of Cozy Beachside Haven - Panoramic Radhime Retreat with Balcony Dining a remarkable choice for travelers seeking a blend of relaxation and exploration in Vlorë.
