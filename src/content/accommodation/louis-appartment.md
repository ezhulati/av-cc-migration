This non-smoking apartment is a haven of space and comfort, featuring two well-appointed bedrooms, a cozy living room equipped with a flat-screen TV for entertainment, a fully equipped kitchen for those who love to cook, and a bathroom complete with either a bath or shower and plush bathrobes for that extra touch of luxury.

For those interested in exploring the local area, Louis Appartment serves as an excellent base. The historic Kuzum Baba and the vibrant Independence Square are both within a 19 km radius, offering a glimpse into the rich culture and history of the region. Moreover, for guests arriving by air, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is 168 km away, making the apartment accessible for international travelers.

Louis Appartment is not just a place to stay; it's a gateway to experiencing the beauty and charm of Orikum, providing all the essentials for a memorable visit.
