Spanning a generous layout, the apartment is well-appointed with a bedroom, a bathroom, and comes fully furnished with bed linen and towels for convenience. Entertainment needs are catered to with a flat-screen TV equipped with streaming services, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration. The dining area and fully equipped kitchen offer guests the freedom to prepare their own meals, adding a touch of home. The highlight, however, is the balcony that presents breathtaking sea views, promising serene mornings and enchanting sunsets.

For those minor necessities or quick snacks, a minimarket on the premises provides utmost convenience.

Situated just 9.4 km from the Rock of Kavaje and 37 km from the historical Former Residence of Enver Hoxha, The Sunset Apartament offers an excellent base for exploring the rich culture and history of the area. Moreover, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 31 km away, makes it an ideal choice for both domestic and international travelers seeking a blend of comfort, convenience, and scenic beauty in Durrës.
