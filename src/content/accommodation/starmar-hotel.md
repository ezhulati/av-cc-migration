For those seeking a more intimate connection with nature, the ground-floor apartments at Starmar present a rare find, each with its own private garden, offering a tranquil space to unwind.

Moreover, the proximity to Tirana International Airport Mother Teresa, just 18 km away, adds to the convenience, making Starmar a compelling choice for travelers seeking both relaxation and exploration.
