For those looking to explore the local area, Ri Beach is a mere 2.1 km away, making for an easy and scenic walk or short drive. Similarly, Independence Square, a notable landmark, is just 2.3 km from the hotel, offering guests a glimpse into the rich history and culture of Vlorë. For international travelers, the convenience of Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport being 151 km away means that FA\_HOLIDAYS serves as a comfortable and accessible base for both short and extended stays in the region.
