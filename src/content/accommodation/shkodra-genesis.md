Guests are welcomed into a generously sized apartment that boasts not only a balcony with breathtaking mountain views but also a suite of modern comforts. The layout includes a cozy bedroom, a stylish living area equipped with a flat-screen TV, and a kitchen that comes fully fitted with an oven and a fridge. The presence of two bathrooms, each featuring a bidet, adds an extra layer of convenience. Upon arrival, visitors are greeted with a personal touch-fruits, chocolates, or cookies, setting the tone for a memorable stay. Additionally, an outdoor dining space invites guests to savor meals amidst the scenic backdrop.

For those looking to explore beyond, Podgorica Airport is conveniently situated just 58 km from the apartment, making Shkodra Genesis an ideal base for both relaxation and adventure in this vibrant region.
