This one-bedroom apartment doesn't skimp on amenities. It boasts a cozy living room complete with a flat-screen TV equipped with streaming services for those evenings when guests prefer a quiet night in. The kitchenette is thoughtfully equipped with a fridge and minibar, catering to the needs of those who enjoy the flexibility of preparing their own meals. Additionally, the inclusion of slippers adds a touch of homey comfort to the bathroom facilities.

For dining al fresco, an outdoor dining area is available, allowing guests to enjoy their meals amidst the gentle buzz of the surrounding streets. While the property maintains a non-smoking policy, ensuring a clean and fresh environment, it also positions itself conveniently close to Golem Beach, just 2.5 km away for those craving beachside relaxation.

Cultural enthusiasts will find the apartment's location advantageous, with the former Residence of Enver Hoxha and the historic Durres Amphitheatre located 42 km and 11 km away, respectively. For ease of travel, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is a manageable 36 km from the apartment, making Ervin's Beach Apartment an ideal base for exploring the rich history and natural beauty of Durrës and its surroundings.
