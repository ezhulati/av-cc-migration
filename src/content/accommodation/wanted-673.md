This apartment doesn't just offer a place to stay; it provides a home away from home with its well-appointed amenities. Guests can enjoy the luxury of a private balcony offering sweeping city views, a rarity in such a sought-after location. The living space is thoughtfully designed with a cozy bedroom, a modern living room equipped with a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a fully equipped kitchen boasting an oven and a fridge for those who prefer to prepare their own meals. The convenience of a private bathroom with a shower adds to the comfort of the stay.

The entire property prides itself on being a smoke-free zone, ensuring a clean and healthy environment for its guests. The inclusion of a lift and the provision of private check-in and check-out services underscore the property's commitment to guest convenience and privacy. Complimentary WiFi accessible throughout the premises allows guests to stay connected with the world or plan their next adventure in Durrës.

For those needing essentials or quick snacks, the on-site minimarket is a boon, eliminating the need to venture far for supplies. While the allure of Durrës and its beaches might be the main draw, the apartment's proximity to notable landmarks like Skanderbeg Square and the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, located 41 km and 45 km away respectively, invites exploration beyond the immediate area. For guests arriving by air, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is conveniently 36 km away, with the apartment offering a paid shuttle service for a hassle-free transfer.

Wanted 673 stands as a testament to thoughtful hospitality, blending convenience, comfort, and the charm of Durrës into an unforgettable stay.
