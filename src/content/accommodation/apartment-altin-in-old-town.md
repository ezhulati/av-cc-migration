The apartment itself is a study in comfort and privacy. Spanning two bedrooms, it is equipped with air conditioning to ensure a pleasant environment regardless of the weather outside. The inclusion of a bathroom equipped with a bidet, shower, and complimentary slippers adds a touch of luxury to the stay. Entertainment needs are well catered to with a flat-screen TV, and the thoughtful addition of soundproofing and a private entrance underscores the apartment's commitment to guest privacy.

For those looking to unwind, a shared lounge area provides the perfect setting for relaxation. Additionally, the convenience of airport transfers and the availability of a car rental service facilitate exploration beyond the apartment's immediate surroundings.

Situated 117 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, Apartment Altin offers a blend of convenience, comfort, and security, making it an appealing choice for travelers seeking an immersive experience in Berat's old town.
