This air-conditioned apartment is a haven of space and light, boasting two well-appointed bedrooms and a living area equipped with a flat-screen TV, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploration. The heart of the apartment, a fully equipped kitchen complete with a dishwasher and an oven, invites guests to prepare and savor their meals in the comfort of their temporary home. Perhaps the most captivating feature is the outdoor dining area, where guests can dine al fresco while soaking in the breathtaking sea views, all in the privacy afforded by a dedicated entrance.

For those traveling to or from Ioannina, the nearest airport is conveniently located 95 km away, making Leon Apartments 3 an ideal base for both short and extended stays in Sarandë.
