Each accommodation unit is a testament to thoughtful design, boasting air conditioning for those warm summer days, a flat-screen TV for entertainment, and a private bathroom equipped with a walk-in shower and complimentary toiletries for that touch of luxury. The highlight, however, is the private terrace or balcony that each unit offers, providing guests with their own outdoor dining area and breathtaking mountain views, ensuring every moment is imbued with the beauty of the surrounding landscape. Convenience is further enhanced with the provision of bed linen and towels in each unit.

The presence of a coffee shop on-site offers the perfect start to the day, while the minimarket caters to any last-minute needs or cravings. Families will particularly appreciate the outdoor play equipment, ensuring that the little ones are entertained throughout their stay. For those seeking adventure or simply wishing to connect with nature, Dream Hotel is ideally located for cycling and fishing activities in the vicinity, not to mention the tranquil garden that invites guests to relax and unwind.

Situated a mere kilometer from Coco Beach and slightly further from Sunset Beach, the hotel's location allows for easy exploration of the area's coastal delights. For international travelers, Corfu International Airport is 93 km away, making Dream Hotel an accessible escape into a world of relaxation and leisure.
