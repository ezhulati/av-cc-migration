Beyond the basics, Hotel Andi elevates the guest experience with thoughtful services including a concierge, a tour desk ready to assist in exploring the local area, and the convenience of a 24-hour front desk. For those arriving from afar, the hotel simplifies travel logistics with airport transfer services and the added benefit of an on-site ATM. Connectivity is a breeze, as guests enjoy access to free WiFi throughout the property.

Morning at Hotel Andi begins with a choice between a buffet or continental breakfast, setting the tone for a day of relaxation or adventure. The hotel's prime location places it a short 500-meter stroll from Golem Beach and just 2.2 km from the bustling Durres Beach, offering a variety of seaside experiences. For travelers, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located 37 km away, makes Hotel Andi an ideal choice for both convenience and coastal charm.
