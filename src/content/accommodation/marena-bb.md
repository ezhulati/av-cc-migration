Guests are welcomed into a space that feels like a home away from home, featuring two cozy bedrooms and three well-appointed bathrooms. The attention to detail is evident in the provision of crisp bed linen, plush towels, and the modern conveniences of a flat-screen TV with cable channels. The dining area and fully equipped kitchen offer all the necessities for a comfortable stay, while the terrace presents breathtaking mountain views, perfect for a moment of reflection or a morning coffee.

The unique charm of Marena B&B is further enhanced by thoughtful touches such as a private entrance, where guests are greeted with wine or champagne and fresh fruits, setting the tone for a memorable stay. The living space, complete with a seating area and a warm fireplace, invites relaxation and leisurely conversations.

For those seeking to enjoy the outdoors, the property does not disappoint. An on-site coffee shop provides the perfect start to the day, while outdoor play equipment and a lush garden offer spaces for play and relaxation. Whether it's enjoying a quiet moment on the balcony or exploring the surrounding attractions, Marena B&B ensures a stay that is both engaging and restful.

Situated a mere 37 km from both Port Ohrid and the iconic Church of St. John at Kaneo, and with Ohrid Airport only 44 km away, Marena B&B positions itself as an ideal base for exploring the rich cultural and natural landscape of the region.
