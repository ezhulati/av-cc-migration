The hotel prides itself on its family-friendly accommodations, with each room boasting a balcony that offers a personal outdoor space for guests to enjoy. Whether it's a view of the bustling city or a quiet moment under the stars, these balconies add a touch of personal retreat to the hotel experience.

The proximity to these sites allows for easy planning of day trips and excursions, ensuring that guests have the opportunity to fully immerse themselves in the local culture and scenic landscapes.

Accessibility is also a highlight, with Ohrid Airport merely 47 km away, making arrivals and departures as smooth as possible for international and domestic travelers alike.
