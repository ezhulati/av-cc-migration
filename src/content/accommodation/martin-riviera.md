Accommodations at Martin Riviera are thoughtfully appointed with private bathrooms, and select units feature terraces, offering guests a peaceful retreat. Families will appreciate the added safety of baby gates, ensuring a worry-free stay for those traveling with little ones.

Located just a short stroll from Vjetër Beach and slightly further from the bustling Vlore Beach, this apartment complex promises an ideal base for exploring the local coastline. For those arriving from afar, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is situated 150 km away, making Martin Riviera an accessible choice for both domestic and international visitors seeking a tranquil beachside escape.
