The villa itself is a testament to spacious living, featuring a balcony that offers tranquil garden views, a cozy bedroom, an inviting living room, and a kitchen equipped with everything needed for a comfortable stay. It's an ideal retreat for those seeking a blend of relaxation and exploration, with Coco Bongo Beach only 2 km away and the historic Kuzum Baba at a distance of 7.8 km.

For travelers flying in, the convenience of Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, situated 157 km from the villa, ensures a hassle-free journey to this exquisite destination. Vila Rexhepaj not only promises a memorable stay but also serves as a gateway to the enchanting surroundings of Vlorë.
