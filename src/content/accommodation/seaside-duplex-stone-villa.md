This villa is thoughtfully designed to accommodate families or groups, featuring two bedrooms equipped with cozy double beds and a third bedroom tailored for friends or younger guests, with three single beds. The kitchen is well-appointed with an oven and a refrigerator, catering to guests' culinary needs, while the inclusion of towels and bed linen adds a touch of home. The presence of two private bathrooms, each with a shower and bidet, underscores the villa's commitment to comfort and convenience.

One of the highlights of staying at Seaside Duplex Stone Villa is the complimentary access to on-site barbecue facilities, perfect for evenings of culinary exploration under the stars.

Positioned 43 km from the lush landscapes of Paleokastritsa, the villa boasts captivating sea views, promising a backdrop of natural beauty for your stay. Although private parking is a brief walk away, at 300 metres, this slight distance is a small trade-off for the tranquility and scenic setting offered.

Seaside Duplex Stone Villa is not just a place to stay; it's a destination that promises a blend of relaxation, privacy, and scenic beauty, making it an ideal choice for those seeking a serene getaway by the sea.
