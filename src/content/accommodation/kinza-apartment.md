Guests are welcomed into a generously sized apartment that boasts a balcony framing picturesque mountain views. The interior is thoughtfully designed with two bedrooms, a cozy living area equipped with a flat-screen TV, and a kitchen that doesn't skimp on amenities, including a dishwasher and a fridge. The convenience extends to the bathroom, where a walk-in shower awaits, and for those in need, towels and linens are available upon request. Kinza Apartment ensures a peaceful stay with its non-smoking and soundproof rooms, making it a sanctuary for those seeking tranquility and privacy.

Strategically located, the apartment is a mere 2.5 km away from the historical Former Residence of Enver Hoxha and within easy reach of the Rock of Kavaje, setting the stage for exploratory adventures into the region's rich history and natural beauty. For travelers, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, just 16 km away, adds an extra layer of convenience to the Kinza Apartment experience.

Kinza Apartment is not just a place to stay; it's a gateway to exploring the vibrant culture and landscapes of Sauk, making it an ideal choice for travelers seeking both relaxation and adventure.
