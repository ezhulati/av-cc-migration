Strategically positioned, Holiday House is a mere stone's throw away from some of the region's most notable landmarks. It is situated 40 km from the historic Skanderbeg Square, 44 km from the scenic views of the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, and a short 33 km journey from the natural beauty of the Rock of Kavaje. Additionally, the intriguing Former Residence of Enver Hoxha and the ancient Durres Amphitheatre are within easy reach, located 41 km and 28 km away, respectively.

The holiday home itself is a testament to thoughtful accommodation, featuring a single bedroom complemented by a fully equipped kitchen and a bathroom designed for comfort. Entertainment is readily available through the inclusion of a flat-screen TV, and guests are treated to delightful garden views, adding a touch of tranquility to their stay.

For those keen on exploring further, the House of Leaves and the National Museum of History Albania are both 40 km from the property, offering a glimpse into Albania's rich cultural heritage. Convenience is further enhanced by the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, just 32 km away, making Holiday House an ideal choice for travelers seeking a blend of relaxation and exploration in Durrës.
