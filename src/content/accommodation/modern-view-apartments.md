Guests are welcomed into a generously sized apartment featuring two bedrooms, each thoughtfully designed to provide a restful night's sleep. The living space is equipped with a TV for entertainment and a kitchenette that caters to every culinary need, including a dishwasher, oven, washing machine, microwave, and toaster. The addition of a private entrance enhances the sense of exclusivity and privacy for those staying.

For convenience, a minimarket on the premises ensures that essentials are always within reach.

Explorers will appreciate the apartment's proximity to local attractions, with the Rock of Kavaje just 7.8 km away and the historical Former Residence of Enver Hoxha 37 km from the doorstep. For those traveling by air, Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is conveniently located 31 km away, making Modern View Apartments an ideal base for both short and extended stays in the region.
