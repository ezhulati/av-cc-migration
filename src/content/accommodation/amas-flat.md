This air-conditioned apartment doesn't just promise a place to stay; it offers a home away from home. With two generously sized bedrooms, a living space adorned with a flat-screen TV, and a balcony that presents breathtaking mountain views, guests are invited to relax in style. The inclusion of outdoor furniture on the balcony further enhances the appeal, providing a serene spot to enjoy a morning coffee or an evening glass of wine.

For those who prefer to dine in, the fully equipped kitchen caters to every culinary need. Complete with a dishwasher, oven, and washing machine, it ensures that long-term stays are as comfortable as short ones. The convenience of free WiFi throughout the property and the availability of private parking on site are thoughtful touches that underscore the flat's commitment to guest satisfaction.

While the allure of AMA's Flat is undeniable, its location also serves as a gateway to further exploration. The Rock of Kavaje, located 44 km away, offers a unique day trip opportunity, while the Bektashi World Centre, just 2 km from the apartment, provides a glimpse into the spiritual heritage of the area. For those traveling by air, the Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport is conveniently located 16 km away, ensuring easy arrivals and departures.

In summary, AMA's Flat stands out as a top-tier accommodation option for those visiting Tirana, offering both the comforts of home and the convenience of a prime location for city exploration.
