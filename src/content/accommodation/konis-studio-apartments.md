The accommodations at KONI's Studio Apartments are designed with the modern traveler in mind. Each apartment is equipped with essential amenities, including air conditioning for those warm Tirana days, a flat-screen TV for evening entertainment, and a private bathroom featuring a bidet and hair dryer for added convenience. For guests desiring a breath of fresh air without stepping out, select units boast balconies offering a glimpse of the city's dynamic rhythm.

Beyond the comfort of their rooms, guests will appreciate the availability of free WiFi throughout the property, ensuring that staying connected is never a hassle. Although private parking is available for an additional fee, the ease of access to notable attractions such as Rinia Park, the Clock Tower of Tirana, and the Et'hem Bey Mosque more than compensates. These landmarks, along with the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, make KONI's Studio Apartments a compelling choice for both leisure and business travelers looking to immerse themselves in the local culture while enjoying the comforts of home.
