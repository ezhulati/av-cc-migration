The apartment itself is a testament to modern living, boasting air conditioning for those warm summer days. It features a cozy bedroom, a welcoming living room, and a fully equipped kitchen complete with an oven and coffee machine, catering to all culinary needs. The inclusion of a bathroom equipped with a bidet and slippers, alongside towels and bed linen, adds a touch of home comfort. The added benefit of a private entrance enhances the sense of privacy and exclusivity.

For convenience, a minimarket on the premises ensures that guests have easy access to essentials without having to venture far. Those looking to unwind will find solace in the apartment's garden, a peaceful enclave perfect for relaxation.

Located 44 kilometers from the historic Skanderbeg Square and 48 kilometers from the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, Lavender Home serves as a convenient base for exploring the wider area. With Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport just 38 kilometers away, it offers a seamless connection for international travelers. Lavender Home stands out as a prime choice for guests in search of comfort, convenience, and a touch of tranquility in Golem.
