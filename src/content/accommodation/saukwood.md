The apartment itself is a testament to modern living, featuring three well-appointed bedrooms, a kitchen equipped with everything needed for a home-cooked meal, and two pristine bathrooms. Entertainment is readily available through a flat-screen TV, ensuring that guests have both the comforts of home and the luxury of a hotel.

For those looking to venture further, the Rock of Kavaje stands 46 km away, offering a unique day trip opportunity, while the serene Saint Paul Cathedral is just a short 3.8 km drive, perfect for those seeking cultural enrichment. Convenience is further underscored by the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, located only 17 km from Saukwood, making arrivals and departures as smooth as possible.

While private parking is available for an additional charge, the ease of access to both local sights and distant attractions positions Saukwood as a compelling choice for visitors to Sauk, blending convenience, comfort, and the promise of an unforgettable stay.
