Guests are welcomed into a space that feels like home, with a bedroom that promises restful nights, a bathroom stocked with essentials, a living area designed for relaxation, and a fully equipped kitchen for culinary adventures. The addition of a flat-screen TV with streaming services means entertainment is always at hand, while the balcony serves as the perfect spot for enjoying a glass of wine or champagne against the backdrop of the sea.

For those who prefer their conveniences within reach, the apartment does not disappoint. A coffee shop on the premises caters to caffeine needs, and for days when guests wish to explore the local sights without the hassle of meal planning, packed lunches are available upon request. The commitment to guest comfort extends to offering a dressing room and laundry service, ensuring a hassle-free stay.

Active guests will find their needs met with on-site fitness classes, while the surrounding area invites adventure with opportunities for diving and fishing. Bike hire is available for those who wish to venture further, and a picnic area within the apartment complex provides a charming setting for a day spent outdoors.
