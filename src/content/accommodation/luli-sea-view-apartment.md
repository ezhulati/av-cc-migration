Not one, but two bathrooms, each with a shower, ensure that convenience and privacy are never compromised. The highlight, however, is the balcony. Here, guests can unwind amidst outdoor furniture, soaking up breathtaking sea views, all from the comfort of their private retreat. Soundproofing and a separate entrance further enhance the sense of exclusivity.

Situated a mere 1.1 km from the VIP Beach and a scenic 15 km drive from the lush expanses of Butrint National Park, Luli Sea View Apartment positions itself as an ideal base for explorers. Moreover, with Ioannina Airport 96 km away, it remains conveniently accessible for international and domestic travelers alike.
