Notably, the entire space is a non-smoking environment, ensuring a clean and fresh atmosphere.

For those who love to bask in the sun, the sun terrace and garden provide the perfect setting, and the barbecue facilities are a delightful bonus for al fresco dining enthusiasts. The promise of full-day security, a 24-hour front desk, and complimentary WiFi throughout the property further enhances the guest experience, offering both peace of mind and connectivity.

Additional conveniences include a car rental service, making exploration of Tirana's must-visit sites like the National Museum of History Albania, the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet, and the House of Leaves effortlessly accessible. For guests arriving by air, the proximity to Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport, just 13 km away, is complemented by the availability of a paid airport shuttle service, ensuring a smooth transition from arrival to relaxation.

In summary, Cozy Big Apartment with Balcony is not just a place to stay; it's a gateway to experiencing the best of Tirana, combining the comforts of home with the luxuries of a top-tier accommodation.
