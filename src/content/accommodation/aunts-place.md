The apartment itself is a study in thoughtful accommodation, boasting a single bedroom that merges comfort with functionality. Guests will find themselves at home with a flat-screen TV, a fully equipped kitchen, and the convenience of a washing machine, all within a smoke-free environment. The inclusion of a bathroom equipped with a shower adds to the practicality of the space, ensuring a stay that is as comfortable as it is convenient.

For those arriving by air, the proximity to Podgorica Airport, located just 58 km away, is a notable advantage. Moreover, Aunt's Place simplifies travel logistics with the option of a paid airport shuttle service, making the journey to and from the airport as effortless as possible.

In essence, Aunt's Place presents itself as a prime choice for guests who value both the comforts of home and the ease of access to local attractions.
