The apartment itself is a spacious haven, equipped with a bedroom that promises restful nights. The living space is adorned with a flat-screen TV and extends into a fully equipped kitchen, where guests can find everything from an oven and toaster to a washing machine and fridge, catering to all culinary needs. Moreover, the inclusion of a balcony allows for an immersive experience of the city's vibrant atmosphere.

For those everyday essentials, the convenience of a minimarket on the premises cannot be overstated. Adventure seekers will find the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car within reach, located 43 km away, offering an unforgettable journey above the city. Meanwhile, the Rock of Kavaje, a mere 3.9 km from the apartment, presents an intriguing visit. Accessibility is also a highlight, with Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport just 33 km away, making Emi Apartment an ideal base for both short and extended stays in Durrës.
