A mere stone's throw from cultural landmarks such as the Former Residence of Enver Hoxha and less than a kilometer from the intriguing House of Leaves, guests find themselves perfectly positioned to explore the rich tapestry of Tirana's history and attractions. The Rock of Kavaje, a further afield attraction, remains accessible at 43 km, offering a glimpse into the natural beauty surrounding the urban landscape.

The apartment itself boasts a spacious layout, featuring a bedroom designed for restful nights. The inclusion of a flat-screen TV and a fully equipped kitchen-complete with an oven, fridge, washing machine, stovetop, and essential kitchenware-caters to the needs of modern travelers, whether they're staying for business or leisure. The provision of towels and bed linen adds a touch of home comfort, while the non-smoking and soundproof environment ensures a peaceful retreat from the city's hustle and bustle.
