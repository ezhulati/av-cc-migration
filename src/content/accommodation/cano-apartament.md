Entertainment needs are catered to with the inclusion of a flat-screen TV, making it an ideal retreat for families or groups.

One of Cano Apartment's most notable features is its terrace, offering a space for guests to relax and unwind. Its proximity to key attractions adds to its appeal; Durres Beach is a mere 600 meters away, inviting guests to enjoy the sun and sea. For those interested in exploring further, the Rock of Kavaje is just 6.8 km away, and the Dajti Ekspres Cable Car, offering breathtaking views, is within a 42 km drive.

Located 38 km from Skanderbeg Square, the apartment provides an excellent base for visitors looking to explore the historical and cultural offerings of the area. Additionally, the convenience of being 32 km from Tirana International Mother Teresa Airport makes Cano Apartment a compelling choice for both domestic and international travelers.

In summary, Cano Apartment offers a blend of comfort, convenience, and accessibility, making it a highly recommended stay for anyone visiting Durrës.
