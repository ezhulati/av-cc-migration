The interiors of these apartments are a testament to modern design, featuring an open-plan lounge that is both spacious and welcoming, equipped with a flat-screen TV for entertainment. The inclusion of a dining table and a well-appointed kitchenette, complete with a stovetop and fridge, ensures that guests have everything they need to feel at home.

Strategically positioned, Apartments Piazza is just a two-minute walk from a variety of local dining options and cozy cafés, offering a taste of Himare's vibrant culinary scene. For those intrigued by history and culture, Himare Castle lies a short 4 km journey away, promising an enriching excursion. Moreover, the picturesque coastal town of Saranda is within easy reach, located 52 km from the property, making Apartments Piazza an ideal base for exploring the broader region.
