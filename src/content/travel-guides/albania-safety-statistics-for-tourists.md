###Key Takeaways

- **Overall safe:** Albania remains a Level‑2 destination; violent crime against tourists is rare.

- **Guard your stuff:** Pickpocketing is the primary tourist issue—use zipped bags and hotel safes.

- **Roads and driving:** Poor driving habits and variable road quality pose the greatest hazard; avoid night drives and consider hiring a local driver.

- **Medical backup:** Outside Tirana, hospitals lack advanced care—buy travel insurance with medical evacuation and drink bottled water.

- **Know the numbers:** 112 (any emergency), 129 (police), 127 (ambulance), 128 (fire).

- **Nature watch:** Earthquakes are infrequent but possible; winter floods can close northern roads—monitor weather alerts.

## Crime: Low‑to‑Moderate—and Mostly Non‑Violent

Albania saw 33,845 offences in 2023—still below the 2021 surge and near a 10‑year low. Homicides dropped to 34, while classic tourist crimes such as pick‑pocketing fell 17 % from 2020 to 2023.([instat.gov.al](https://www.instat.gov.al/media/13230/crime-and-criminal-justice-statistics-2023.pdf))

**What this means for travelers**

- Pickpockets focus on buses, markets, and busy bars in Tirana and Sarandë.

- Violent crime rarely involves tourists; organised‑crime disputes are internal.

- Use marked taxis, ignore “unofficial guides,” and keep valuables zipped.

## Road Safety: Biggest Practical Risk

Driving standards lag EU norms. Albania still posts one of Europe’s highest per‑capita road‑death rates (59 / million in 2022) despite steady improvement. Speeding, limited lighting, and livestock on rural roads remain hazards.([transport-community.org](https://www.transport-community.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Fatalities-for-2022-Transport-Community_V2.pdf)) The UK FCDO calls local driving “hazardous and often aggressive.”([gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/albania/safety-and-security))

**Tips**

- Prefer daylight travel on main highways.

- Decline night drives in mountainous areas.

- If you’re not used to assertive traffic, hire a driver.

## Health & Medical Care

Public hospitals outside Tirana lack advanced equipment; private clinics in the capital deliver better care but require cash up‑front. Bring prescriptions—pharmacies may run out. Tap water is not reliably potable; stick to sealed bottles.([gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/albania/safety-and-security))

**COVID‑19**: Albania recorded ~335 k cases and 3,600 deaths; vaccines are available, and travel restrictions ended in 2022.([worldometers.info](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/albania/)) Carry routine vaccination proof; no special shots are mandated.

## Natural Hazards

- **Earthquakes:** The 6.4‑magnitude Durrës quake (51 fatalities) in Nov 2019 underscores risk.([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/26/albania-earthquake-rescuers-search-rubble-after-most-powerful-tremor-in-decades)) Minor tremors are common; know evacuation routes.

- **Flooding:** Winter storms can swamp northern plains and cut rural roads. Monitor local weather apps.

- **Wildfires:** July–August heat brings hillside fires—heed local bans.

## How Peaceful Is Albania Compared to Europe?

- **Gallup Law & Order 2022:** 80/100—similar to Spain; locals trust police at 60 % and 70 % feel safe walking at night.([albaniandailynews.com](https://albaniandailynews.com/news/albanians-feel-less-safe-than-in-2022-gallup-index-found))

- **Global Peace Index 2023:** 41st worldwide, ahead of Italy and the US.([visionofhumanity.org](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/resources/gpi-2023-wall-chart/))

## Practical Takeaways for 2025 Visitors

- **Stay street‑smart**: Secure cash and passports; avoid poorly lit back‑streets late at night.

- **Drive defensively—or hire a pro.**

- **Buy travel insurance with med‑evac.** Albania’s hospitals are improving but not Western‑grade.

- **Mind the weather.** Check quake building codes if booking coastal apartments; monitor rain‑alerts in winter.

- **Know your numbers:** 112 (any emergency) and 129/127/128 for direct services.

**Bottom line:** Albania remains a welcoming, affordable, and generally safe destination. Most visitors encounter nothing more serious than a hectic roundabout—but informed preparation keeps it that way.
