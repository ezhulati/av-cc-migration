## What money Albania uses

The official currency is the Albanian lek, written as ALL or lek. Say it “/LEHK/.”

Cash still matters. Cards work in cities, hotels, supermarkets, and many restaurants. 

In villages, markets, roadside stands, and small cafés, expect cash only.

**Coins**: 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 Lek *(click to expand)*

**Banknotes**: 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000 Lek *(click to expand)*

For more details on the banknotes and their security features, you can visit the [Bank of Albania](https://www.bankofalbania.org/Currency/Banknotes_in_circulation/).

## “Old” lek and “new” lek

Albania redenominated the currency in 1965 at ten to one. Some people still speak in “old lek,” mostly older speakers and outside big cities. Written prices use new lek. Verbal prices are where confusion happens. If a number sounds too high, divide by ten or ask out loud: “Lekë të reja apo të vjetra?” (/LEH-kuh tuh REH-yah AH-po tuh VYET-rah?/).

###Real examples

Market vendor says “5,000 lek.” In most cases that means 500 new lek.Bus driver says “1,000 lek.” Often that is 100 new lek.Printed menu shows “800 lek.” That is 800 new lek.Parking meter shows “200 lek.” Always new lek.

## ATMs and airport cash

[Tirana International Airport](https://albaniavisit.com/travel-guide/tirana-international-airport/) has several bank ATMs in arrivals after customs. Use a debit card to avoid credit-card cash-advance fees. When an ATM or card terminal asks to charge you in your home currency, decline the conversion and choose lek. This avoids inflated dynamic-conversion rates. Fees vary by bank and by your card issuer. Take a small first withdrawal for your ride and first day. Use bank-branch ATMs in town for larger amounts. Shield the keypad. Keep your card in sight at terminals.

## Exchanging money

Use banks or licensed exchange offices for fair rates. Bring euros, US dollars, or British pounds. Avoid hotel desks if you care about the rate. Albania uses a comma for decimals and a dot for thousands. “1.200” means one thousand two hundred. “1,20” would mean one lek and twenty qindar, which you will not encounter in practice. You will struggle to exchange lek outside Albania, so convert leftovers before departure.

  ###Track and Compare Rates

  

    Before you exchange money in Albania, check the real-time EUR to ALL exchange rate using XE.
    It helps you avoid inflated rates at kiosks, airports, and hotels — so you know what your Euros are actually worth.
  

  
  
    
  

  

    XE doesn’t convert physical cash — but it’s the most accurate tool for checking current rates before you exchange.
    Keep this handy while you travel.

## Cards, contactless, and small print

Visa and Mastercard are widely accepted where cards are taken. American Express works in some hotels and larger restaurants but not everywhere. Contactless is common in Tirana and other big towns. Expect to enter a PIN above small amounts. Some shops add a small fee for card payments or set a minimum. If the terminal asks you to pick a currency, choose lek.

## Street-smart habits

Carry small notes for daily spend and keep larger bills separate. Say the number back when prices are noisy or rushed. If a price feels off for the setting, ask whether it is old or new lek, or write the number on your phone. For change, ask clearly and wait for it in full before you leave.
