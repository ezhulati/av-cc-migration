## Albania Visa Requirements

Albania is visa-free for most nationalities, including the US, Canada, and the EU. 

This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about entering Albania, regardless of your nationality, purpose of visit, or method of entry. 

We've organized the information to help you easily find what applies to your specific situation while understanding the broader context of Albanian entry requirements.

Whether you're a tourist, business traveler, student, or digital nomad, this guide ensures you're well-prepared for your journey.

## Entry Requirements (All Travelers)

## Visa Requirements 

Before diving into specific requirements, you'll need to understand which category of traveler you are. This will determine your entry requirements and application process.

Please note that visa requirements can change over time, so it's always best to verify the most current information with the Albanian authorities or the nearest embassy or consulate before making travel plans.

## Upcoming Changes: 2025 ETIAS

Starting in 2025, citizens from over 60 countries, including the USA, Canada, Australia, and others, will require an ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorization System) to visit any country in the Schengen Area visa-free. ETIAS is a quick online application that provides passport, contact, and European travel details. It costs a fee of €7 and is generally approved within minutes, allowing multiple visa-free Schengen entries for up to 90 days in 3 years.

## Albania and the Schengen Area

As of 2025, Albania is not part of the Schengen Area, but its visa policy closely resembles that of the Schengen countries. Albania grants 90-day visa-free entry to citizens of Schengen Annex II countries, with a few exceptions, and also offers visa-free entry to nine additional countries not part of the Schengen Annex II list.
