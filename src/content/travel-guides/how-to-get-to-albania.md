## Reaching Albania

###By Air

Flying directly into Albania is the fastest and most convenient option for international travelers.

Tirana International Airport is the only airport in Albania, just 15 minutes from Tirana.

Many major airlines offer **[direct flights to Tirana](https://flights.albaniavisit.com)** from European hubs like London, Paris, Rome, and Istanbul.

Popular routes from the U.S. are from New York (JFK) and Newark (EWR), with flight times averaging 12-14 hours, including layovers.

Most visitors can **[enter visa-free](https://albaniavisit.com/travel-guide/entry-visa/)** for up to one year.

Flying is ideal if you're short on time or prefer direct transport. However, airfares to Tirana tend to be higher than for other modes of transport.

###By Sea

For a more scenic journey, consider taking the ferry:

High-speed boats and slower ferries sail to **[Saranda](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/saranda/)** from **Corfu, Greece,** in under an hour.

Overnight ferries from **Bari, Italy,** take around nine hours to reach **[Durrës](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/durres/)** on Albania's coast.

These leisurely voyages offer beautiful coastal scenery at a lower cost than flying.

###By Land

Overland options like buses are cheaper but involve long travel times:

- From Greece: Buses from Athens (8 hours) and Thessaloniki (7 hours) reach Tirana.

- A bus from Skopje**, **Macedonia (7.5 hours) connects to Tirana.

- From Montenegro, a twice-weekly bus runs between Budva and Tirana.

Ground transport is best for travelers on a budget who value the overland experience.
