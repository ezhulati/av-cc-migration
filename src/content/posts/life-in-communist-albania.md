The year was 1990 when someone spray-painted rock lyrics on a building wall in Tirana.

My sister and I saw them first. We'd been taught English by our father from an early age, so we immediately recognized the words and giggled at each other. We knew exactly what they were: Scorpions lyrics, from "_Winds of Change._" The irony wasn't lost on us even as kids.

The authorities panicked. They called my father-an [English professor and diplomat](https://albaniavisit.com/about/team/ilia-zhulati/). They needed him to translate because they were certain this graffiti was either Western spy communication or dangerous propaganda.

My father didn't keep up with modern pop culture, so he didn't initially realize what the lyrics were until my sister and I convinced him they were from a Scorpions song. By the late 1980s, almost every household in Albania was watching Western media through rooftop rabbit-ear antennas. These teenagers weren't unique-they were just bold enough to paint what everyone was secretly listening to.

The investigation was serious. Writing unauthorized text in public could mean years in prison. My father came home that night and told my mother what he'd discovered. I remember them laughing-quietly, the way adults laughed about things that weren't actually funny. They weren't laughing at the kids. They were laughing at a system so paranoid it called in diplomatic translators to decode rock lyrics while actual winds of change swept across Eastern Europe.

The regime couldn't tell the difference anymore between real threats and teenagers with spray paint.

I lived through the final years of [Europe's most isolated communist state](https://albaniavisit.com/communist-era/). Born in Albania, I was nine when the system collapsed in 1991. Old enough to remember the 4 AM queues, the whispered adult conversations, the thrill of watching Western TV through those illegal antennas. Too young to fully understand what any of it meant.

This is what life actually felt like inside Europe's last Stalinist stronghold-not the Cold War mythology, but the human reality of surviving in a country with [173,000 concrete bunkers](https://albaniavisit.com/albania-bunkers/), where jeans could get you interrogated, and where brilliant minds competed fiercely because intellect was the only currency the state couldn't control.

## Daily Rhythms

By the 1980s, the desperate dawn queues of earlier decades had largely disappeared. Neighborhoods had bakeries that sold bread, and there was usually enough for every family. Sure, if you wanted hot bread straight from the oven, you might stand in a small line, but nothing dramatic.

Life had a different rhythm than in the West. The workday started early-7 or 8 AM-but most jobs ended by 2 or 3 PM. People came home, often took a nap, then prepared for the evening: dinner followed by the ritual xhiro, the evening stroll through the neighborhood where everyone walked, socialized, and exchanged information.

School followed the same pattern. From first to fourth grade, we attended from 8 AM to noon-just four hours-but with plenty of homework afterward. No cafeterias, no lunch programs, no after-school activities. You didn't bring food to school. The support systems that keep American kids fed and occupied until their parents finish work at 5 or 6 PM simply didn't exist.

My mother, like most women, did the daily shopping. Every day, she'd go to the market for fresh vegetables, bread, fruits, and bring them home to cook for the family. Everything was fresh, seasonal, local. A family of four like ours had access to meat, eggs, oil, seasonal produce. While variety was limited-you couldn't always choose exactly what you wanted-there was plenty of food.

What Western narratives miss is the quality: everything was organic by default. Industrial agriculture never reached Albania. No pesticides, no chemical fertilizers. Those tomatoes with feta cheese in summer, watermelon in July, apples in fall-all tasted remarkably pure and flavorful. The isolation that limited imports preserved traditional farming methods.

## Living Quarters

We lived in a government apartment building with underground bunkers and tunnels connecting the units. The state decided where you lived based on your profession, and your social standing or "political biography." A good profession and biography gave you access cities like Tirana. Bad biography meant remote villages or industrial towns.

The Soviet-style concrete blocks were actually well insulated-something that surprises people now. Yes, winters got cold and you had to bundle up or sit near the wood-burning stove that doubled as our toaster, but the buildings held heat well. The concrete construction meant noise from neighbors was generally not an issue, despite the density. These structures, whatever their aesthetic limitations, were solidly built.

Families made these spaces into homes. My mother kept our apartment immaculate. We had a color television-rare, acquired through my father's diplomatic position. Most families had the same state-provided furniture, but small touches mattered: an embroidered tablecloth, a plant by the window, family photographs.

The privilege of diplomatic families like ours was real but relative. We had Western items from my father's travels-blue jeans that simply didn't exist in Albanian stores. A cassette player and VHS tapes. Occasional imported food. But we weren't wealthy. My father's salary barely covered necessities. "Better" meant having jeans when others had shoes so worn you could feel every pebble through the soles.

My mother would quietly put away Western items when neighbor children visited. Not from fear of being reported-though that was always possible-but because she knew what those jeans represented to families queuing at dawn for bread.

## School

With material wealth eliminated, Albanian schools became intellectual battlegrounds. We competed fiercely in everything-math competitions, literature recitations, science fairs-because academic achievement was the only distinction that mattered.

The system produced remarkable rigor despite severe censorship. By the late 1980s, Albania had transformed from 85% illiteracy to over 90% literacy. Half of university students were women. We studied advanced mathematics and sciences with an intensity that seems impossible now.

But we also learned to maintain dual realities early. At school, we absorbed Marxist-Leninist ideology, swore oaths to the Party, looked forward to receiving our red pioneer scarves in fifth grade. At home, parents whispered different truths.

I never got my pioneer scarf. The system collapsed while I was in fourth grade. One day it was the symbol of belonging, of growing up, of being a proper Albanian student. The next day my friend's mother was using hers as a kitchen rag.

This code-switching was universal. Every Albanian child learned what could be said at school and what stayed within family walls. The intellectual hunger this created-constrained by political boundaries but unleashed in permitted subjects-produced a generation of brilliant minds trapped in an impoverished country.

## Sigurimi

The Sigurimi (Albania's secret police) had 30,000 officers in a population of 3 million. One officer per 100 citizens. But the real surveillance came from the 20% of Albanians who collaborated as informants. Your neighbor. Your colleague. Sometimes your mother-in-law.

One artist discovered his 250-page surveillance file listed 20 informants, including family members. By the mid-1980s, 32,000 people remained in labor camps. Survivors estimate "every third citizen had either served time in labor camps or been interrogated."

I remember the hypervigilance. Adults would suddenly change topics mid-sentence. Conversations had layers-what was said, what was meant, what couldn't be said at all.

Yet the absurdity of it reached peaks like the Scorpions investigation. By the late '80s, almost everyone had illegal antennas to watch Italian TV, Yugoslav broadcasts, even MTV. Everyone knew the outside world existed. But spray-painting proof of that knowledge could destroy your life.

The paranoia extended everywhere. Father Ernest Simoni Troshani spent 28 years in prison for holding a mass. Making the sign of the cross meant three years imprisonment. Owning a Bible brought five years. By 1967, Albania had closed all 2,169 religious buildings, declaring itself the world's first atheist state.

But faith survived underground. Families whispered prayers. Religious holidays became "family gatherings." Sacred objects were hidden for decades. The state could control public space but never conquered private belief.

## Equality

The communist system proclaimed equality while creating new hierarchies. Factory workers and diplomats earned similar salaries. Chinese technicians during the alliance were paid the same as Albanian workers. Everyone received the same ration cards.

But equality meant limited choices. By 1985, average monthly income was $15 in the third-poorest country on Earth. The bunkers-173,000 of them, one for every four Albanians-consumed resources equivalent to twice the Maginot Line while families waited years for washing machines.

Women bore heavy burdens. The state pushed women into the workforce-46% participation by the late 1970s, 40.7% in People's Councils. "Liberation" meant triple shifts: work, endless queues, then household labor because men rarely helped despite official ideology.

Women worked full days, queued for dinner supplies, cooked, cleaned, helped with homework, washed clothes by hand. The Code of the Family mandated equal household labor, but tradition persisted. The state replaced patriarchal authority without eliminating patriarchal attitudes.

## Finding Joy

Despite everything, people found joy. The evening xhiro (stroll) saw hundreds walking main streets-elderly couples, young people, whole families. It was where courtship happened, information exchanged, community maintained.

At home, we rigged kanaçe antennas-aluminum cans fashioned into receivers-to catch foreign broadcasts. By the late 1980s, this was nearly universal. Italian RAI, Yugoslav television, glimpses of MTV.

Albanian families became experts at small rebellions. The annual Festival of Song provided "authorized nonconformity" until Hoxha declared the 1972 edition too Western and prosecuted the organizers. Directors embedded "double meanings, allusions, coded messages" in films. Writer Ismail Kadare navigated censorship through allegory until he defected in 1990, later saying, "You risked being shot for a single word against the regime."

Children found happiness in simple things. Two weeks at Pioneer Camp that we somehow remember fondly. Playing football in streets from dusk till dawn. Locally-made toys we treasured because they were ours.

## Collapse

The end came suddenly but in stages.

January 1990: First revolts in Shkodër. December 1990: Student demonstrations in Tirana. The Communist Party legalized opposition parties on December 11. The Democratic Party formed the next day.

I was nine, watching my world flip overnight. Stalin's statue in Tirana's central square was beheaded. The red pioneer scarves became cleaning rags. Teachers suddenly taught different history. Adults argued in ways that would have meant prison months earlier.

But the revelation that shattered many children came from parents who admitted they'd never believed in Uncle Enver (Albania's dictator). Never supported the Party. Had spent our entire childhoods lying to protect us.

"There was a difference between us," as Lea Ypi wrote about the same discovery. "I believed. I knew nothing else."

The transition brought its own trauma. GDP collapsed 28% in 1991. Industrial output fell 60%. Emergency EU food aid was needed. Crime appeared where it had never existed. The communal bonds forged through shared oppression began dissolving.

Then came the pyramid schemes. One-third of Albania's population lost $1.2 billion. The 1997 uprising saw 1,500 deaths. Entire forests were cut down. Girls were trafficked to Italy. The West that had criticized closed borders now treated Albanian refugees as criminals.

By the 2000s, trust between Albanians had fallen from 24% to 3%. The safe streets became dangerous. The schools struggled. The guaranteed jobs disappeared. We'd traded the certainty of oppression for the uncertainty of chaos.

## Nostalgia

Today those 173,000 bunkers have been removed although some became restaurants, bars, and museums, while others slowly crumble into landscapes that never needed them. [The House of Leaves](https://albaniavisit.com/attractions/house-of-leaves/), former Sigurimi headquarters, won the 2020 Council of Europe Museum Prize for unflinchingly displaying surveillance equipment and interrogation rooms. [The Pyramid of Tirana](https://albaniavisit.com/attractions/pyramid-of-tirana/), built as Hoxha's mausoleum, reopened in 2023 as a technology center where children play on slopes designed for a dictator's glory.

But the complexity remains. A 2016 survey found 42% of Albanians view Hoxha as having positive impact on history. They miss the safety (even knowing its price), the education excellence, the community bonds. They don't miss the surveillance, the shortages, the fear.

This isn't simple nostalgia. It's recognition that different forms of oppression exist-the boot on your neck or the absence of any safety net. The Albanian experience shows humans can adapt to almost anything, find joy in almost anything, survive almost anything. But at costs that echo for generations.

When visitors come to Albania now and see painted apartment blocks, bunkers turned into cafes, and museums in former prisons, they're seeing a country still processing what happened. The pride and self-deprecating humor you'll encounter aren't contradictory-they're two sides of surviving something that defies simple explanation.

Life in communist Albania was nothing like the gray uniformity of Cold War propaganda, nor the workers' paradise of communist mythology, but something more complex-a place where humanity persisted despite systematic attempts to control it.

The last Stalinist state in Europe wasn't just about bunkers and surveillance. It was about people living between survival and dignity, finding ways to remain themselves even when the state tried to own everything from their shoe styles to their thoughts.
