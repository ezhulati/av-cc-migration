I’m Ilia, a proud contributor at **AlbaniaVisit.com**. Born in the mountain village of Grabovë near [Përmet](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/permet/), my love for languages began early, inspired by my grandfather’s own linguistic passion. Despite the challenges of [Communist Albania](https://albaniavisit.com/communist-era/), my determination to master English led me on a remarkable path—from a small village to serving as Albania’s diplomat to the United Nations in New York.

During those transformative years, I had the privilege of helping [establish historic diplomatic ties](https://albaniavisit.com/untold-secrets-albanian-diplomacy/) between Albania and the United States. Later, as an English teacher in Texas, I shared this lifelong love of language with students, bridging cultures and generations.

Today, my mission continues through writing, teaching, and guiding curious travelers. Whether you're exploring Albania’s rich culture, seeking essential phrases for your trip, or diving into the country’s fascinating history, I’m here to support your journey.

**✦ Planning a trip to Albania or want key phrases for your visit? [Reach out](mailto:iliazhulati+av@gmail.com)—I’d love to help.**

Looking forward to sharing Albania’s language and culture with you.
