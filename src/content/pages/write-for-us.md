We‚Äôre especially interested in articles that:

- **Are grounded in real experience** ‚Äî Personal stories, family roots, return visits, slow travel

- **Show the real Albania** ‚Äî Cultural nuance, local voices, unfiltered impressions

- **Balance story and substance** ‚Äî A compelling narrative that also helps people plan

- **Respect the culture** ‚Äî No hype, no sugarcoating, no clich√©s

## Accepted Categories

We publish stories that help readers experience the real Albania through travel, culture, and personal connection. These are our core focus areas:

**Destinations** ‚Äî Cities, towns, and villages with historical, personal, or cultural relevance
**Experiences & Activities** ‚Äî Hikes, festivals, rural traditions, heritage trails, day-to-day travel moments

**Food & Culture** ‚Äî Traditional dishes, cooking customs, food rituals, hospitality traditions
**Personal Essays** ‚Äî Family roots, diaspora stories, cultural reflection, identity

We also welcome pitches that explore Albania through other lenses‚Äîsuch as **music, arts, architecture, or contemporary culture**‚Äîif grounded in experience and relevant to thoughtful travelers.

If you‚Äôre not sure your idea fits, email us. If it‚Äôs rooted in real Albania and written with care, there‚Äôs a good chance we‚Äôll consider it.

## AI-Generated Content Policy

We do **not** publish articles written by generative AI.

## Guest Posts & Promotional Content

We do not accept guest posts written for the purpose of link-building, brand promotion, or SEO gain.

However, if you're a professional with firsthand experience in Albania (e.g. a local guide, artist, NGO worker, chef, or cultural figure) and have a story worth sharing, we‚Äôre open to collaborative, editorially-driven features‚Äîso long as the piece serves the reader, not a brand.

**Want visibility for your company, tour, or project?** We offer limited sponsored editorial opportunities. Contact editor@albaniavisit.com with your proposal, and we‚Äôll send you our media kit.

We do not pay for pitches, drafts, or speculative work. Payment is only made upon final acceptance and publication of the article and images.
