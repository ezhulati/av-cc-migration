# Write For Us

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **[AlbaniaVisit.com](http://AlbaniaVisit.com)**. We publish meaningful, real-world stories and photography that reflect the depth, complexity, and everyday truth of traveling in Albania. If you've experienced something worth telling-and can express it clearly, honestly, and with purpose-we want to hear from you.

📩 **Contact:** editor@albaniavisit.com

## What We Publish

We're not looking for generic "travel content." We publish firsthand stories and reporting that help travelers connect with Albania on a deeper level-through personal connection, cultural context, and useful, trustworthy insight.

We're especially interested in articles that:

*   **Are grounded in real experience** - Personal stories, family roots, return visits, slow travel
*   **Show the real Albania** - Cultural nuance, local voices, unfiltered impressions
*   **Balance story and substance** - A compelling narrative that also helps people plan
*   **Respect the culture** - No hype, no sugarcoating, no clichés

## Accepted Categories

We publish stories that help readers experience the real Albania through travel, culture, and personal connection. These are our core focus areas:

**Destinations** - Cities, towns, and villages with historical, personal, or cultural relevance  
**Experiences & Activities** - Hikes, festivals, rural traditions, heritage trails, day-to-day travel moments  
**Attractions & Landmarks** - Castles, ruins, sacred sites, national parks, and museums  
**Food & Culture** - Traditional dishes, cooking customs, food rituals, hospitality traditions  
**Personal Essays** - Family roots, diaspora stories, cultural reflection, identity

We also welcome pitches that explore Albania through other lenses-such as **music, arts, architecture, or contemporary culture**-if grounded in experience and relevant to thoughtful travelers.

If you're not sure your idea fits, email us. If it's rooted in real Albania and written with care, there's a good chance we'll consider it.

## Submission Requirements

### Writing Standards

*   **Length:** 1,200-2,500 words for feature articles; 800-1,200 for shorter pieces
*   **Voice:** Direct, thoughtful, informed-like a friend who knows the country well
*   **Perspective:** First-person is preferred (when it's your story to tell)
*   **Structure:** If needed we can provide templates to help shape and tell your story
*   **Language:** All submissions must be written in clear, natural English. Native-level fluency is not required, but clarity and readability are essential. We do not accept drafts written in other languages for translation.

### Photography Requirements

*   **4-8 original, high-quality images** required per story
*   **Minimum resolution:** 2000px wide, under 2MB per file
*   **No stock photos.** We want photos that reflect your experience
*   **Captions:** Each photo must include location and context
*   **People:** Must have permission if faces are identifiable

## What We Don't Publish

*   Listicles, SEO fluff, or "Top 10" posts
*   AI-generated articles (see below)
*   Overly promotional content
*   Cultural stereotypes or romanticized portrayals
*   Articles with no personal connection or real insight

## AI-Generated Content Policy

We do **not** publish articles written by generative AI.  
If your piece was written by a machine-or even heavily "co-written"-it will not be accepted. We're looking for work shaped by personal experience, cultural awareness, and human voice.

You're welcome to use AI tools for assistance (brainstorming, outlining, editing, translation), but final content must be fully human-written and reflect your own lived or researched knowledge. We can tell the difference. Submissions that don't meet this standard will be rejected without further review.

## Photo Rights & Licensing

You must own the rights to all photos you submit. If accepted, you grant AlbaniaVisit.com a perpetual, non-exclusive license to use the content across our website, social media, email newsletters, and promotions.

You retain ownership, but once we publish it, it becomes part of our editorial archive.  
We do not remove published articles or images upon later request.

## How to Pitch

Email **editor@albaniavisit.com** with the following:

1.  **Story concept** (200-300 words)
    *   What's the core idea?
    *   Why is it relevant to Albania and to travelers?
    *   What's your personal connection?
2.  **Structure outline**
    *   How will you organize the piece?

    *   Social links or website

## Guest Posts & Promotional Content

We do not accept guest posts written for the purpose of link-building, brand promotion, or SEO gain.

If your goal is to insert backlinks, mention your company, or publish content tied to a commercial agenda, this is not the right platform. We're a reader-first publication focused on real, thoughtful travel and cultural storytelling-not a content placement service.

However, if you're a professional with firsthand experience in Albania (e.g. a local guide, artist, NGO worker, chef, or cultural figure) and have a story worth sharing, we're open to collaborative, editorially-driven features-so long as the piece serves the reader, not a brand.

**Want visibility for your company, tour, or project?** We offer limited sponsored editorial opportunities. Contact editor@albaniavisit.com with your proposal, and we'll send you our media kit.

## Compensation

We pay for quality-well-written, personal stories that meet our editorial standards and come with original photography.

**Our standard rates:**

*   **Feature articles (1,500+ words):** €100
*   **Short articles (800-1,500 words):** €50
*   **Photo essays with captions and story context:** €150

This includes:

*   A fully edited and published piece on AlbaniaVisit.com
*   Original photography (4-8 images)
*   SEO title, meta description, and image captions
*   Lifetime archive in our editorial library

If your story stands out-drives strong traffic, sparks engagement, or is featured in our newsletter-we may offer a **€25-50 performance bonus** at our discretion.

**Payment is issued within 30 days of publication** via PayPal or bank transfer.

We do not pay for pitches, drafts, or speculative work. Payment is only made upon final acceptance and publication of the article and images.
