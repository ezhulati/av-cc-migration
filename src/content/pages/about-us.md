#### Our Reporting

Albaniaâ€™s story isnâ€™t just about stunning landscapes and rich cultureâ€”itâ€™s about unfulfilled potential.

Since communismâ€™s collapse, despite some progress toward European integration, Albania has been overtaken by a kleptocracy that drains resources, enriches the elite, and erodes meritocracyâ€”forcing a new generation to leave.

#### Our Why

We envision an Albania where success is earned, talent stays, and public resources serve the many, not the few.

#### Our Approach

To raise awareness, hold institutions accountable, and demand change, we rely on protected sources, document analysis, news archives, and testimony from within Albania and abroad.

#### Editorial Standards

Our reporting is grounded in international principles of free speech, press freedom, and journalistic integrity. We ensure accuracy, fairness, and responsible reporting based on verifiable evidence, public records, and credible sources.
