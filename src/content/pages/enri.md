I’m Enri, the founder of AlbaniaVisit.com—a project born from both personal roots and a deep commitment to Albania’s future as a world-class travel destination.

I was born and raised in Albania, surrounded by the country’s raw beauty, living history, and everyday charm. After moving abroad, I returned often—as a tourist in my own homeland. Those visits were eye-opening. Albania’s potential was enormous, but so were the challenges: limited information, unreliable infrastructure, and the feeling that you needed to know someone local just to get around.

I created **AlbaniaVisit.com** to bridge that gap—for you—the curious traveler.

My goal is to help you discover the real Albania, not just what shows up on Instagram. I’ve spent years building this site into a trusted, independent guide to help travelers experience Albania like a local—with clarity, confidence, and cultural respect.

Whether you’re planning your first visit or your fifth, I hope this platform empowers you to explore Albania in a way that’s authentic, informed, and deeply rewarding.

Safe travels,
