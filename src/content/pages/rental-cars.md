## A Practical Guide for Tourists

If you want to fully experience Albania's stunning landscapes and historic towns, renting a car is the way to go. Having a vehicle lets you explore at your own pace.

## Rental Car Companies

When renting a car in Albania, you have two main options: international brands like Sixt, Europcar, and Avis or local companies that often offer better prices but have older car fleets with less-than-stringent maintenance.

I prefer peace of mind, so I use comparison sites like [**Discover Cars**](https://geni.us/car-rental){rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank"}, [**Rental Cars**](https://rentalcars.tp.st/JaPeOgVv), and [**Booking Cars**](https://booking.tp.st/KxPgcuWn), which allow you to compare prices and book online, making the process hassle-free.

## Affordable Local Car Rentals

For budget-conscious travelers, renting from locals can be an attractive alternative.

Platforms like [**Rent from Locals**](https://geni.us/rent-cars-from-locals){rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank"} connect tourists with local car owners, offering a wide range of vehicles at competitive prices.

Whether you need an economy car, a spacious van, or a rugged SUV, you can find options to suit your needs and budget.

Booking through [**Rent from Locals**](https://geni.us/rent-cars-from-locals){rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank"} is straightforward and flexible. It offers online reservations, no credit card required, and a flexible cancellation policy.

Once confirmed, the owner will contact you to arrange car delivery and pick-up.

Renting from locals also allows you to support the local economy and potentially connect with insider tips and recommendations from car owners.

## Where to Pick Up Your Car

You can conveniently pick up your rental car at the airport or seaports like the Saranda Port.

Renting from a company based in the city could save you money compared with renting at the airport or seaports, which are more convenient.

Use [**Discover Cars**](https://geni.us/car-rental){rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank"} to compare options and prices for convenience, and book in advance for the best deal.

## What You Need to Rent a Car

You must have a valid driver's license from your home country to rent a car in Albania.

While an [**International Driving Permit**](https://geni.us/driving-permit){rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank"} (IDP) isn't always necessary, getting one is a good idea to avoid legal issues.

You can [**get an IDP online**](https://geni.us/driving-permit){rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank"} or through your local automobile association. Be ready to provide a credit card for a deposit when you pick up your car.

## Choosing the Right Car

Pick a car that suits your itinerary and comfort needs. Compact cars are perfect for city driving and coastal roads, while SUVs are better for mountain regions and rough terrain.

If you prefer an automatic transmission, book early, as they're less common.

## Driving in Albania

Road conditions in Albania can vary. Major cities and highways generally have well-maintained roads, but rural areas may have narrow, potholed lanes.

Remember to drive on the right, wear seat belts, and stick to the speed limits (40 km/h in cities, 80-90 km/h on open roads, and up to 110 km/h on highways).

Be prepared for enthusiastic local driving styles and always drive defensively.

## Parking and Gas Stations

In cities, park in designated areas or garages to avoid fines. Finding a spot near popular attractions like beaches during peak season might take patience.

Gas stations are easy to find, and cash and credit cards are accepted. Albania is still a cash-dependent country, so having cash to pay is a good idea.

## Safety and Emergencies

In an emergency, call 112 for police, medical, or fire assistance. Get insurance coverage from your rental company, and always carry your rental documents.

Consider purchasing comprehensive travel insurance, such as [**Visitors Coverage**](https://visitorscoverage.tp.st/r318ifAz){rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank"} for medical emergencies and trip cancellations.

## Scenic Drives

Albania has some incredible scenic routes, like the SH8 from Vlorë to Saranda, which offers breathtaking coastal views, and the SH75 from Korçë to Përmet, which winds through the mountains.

These drives showcase the country's natural beauty and are not to be missed.

## Hit The Road

With some preparation and knowledge of local driving customs, renting a car in Albania is the perfect way to explore this beautiful country at your speed.

So buckle up and get ready for an unforgettable Albanian road trip.

## Albania Car Rental FAQs

### Is driving in Albania difficult for foreigners?

Due to narrow, winding roads and assertive local drivers, driving in Albania can be challenging. However, major highways and roads in tourist areas are improving. Take precautions, drive defensively, and allow extra travel time. Using a GPS and map as a backup is highly recommended.

### What kind of car should I rent?

Consider carefully vehicle size, ground clearance, transmission type, and overall condition. Small cars are fine for cities but may struggle on rough terrain. An automatic transmission greatly simplifies driving. Inspect the car inside and out before departing the rental lot.

### Can I use my home driver's license?

Most rental car companies accept foreign driver's licenses if you meet the minimum age requirements. Some may require an International Driving Permit (IDP) to accompany your license when renting.

### How expensive is car rental and fuel?

Rental car base rates average $25-100 USD per day, depending on vehicle type, transmission, and season. Fuel recently averaged 140 Lekë (USD 1.25) per liter. Prices do fluctuate, so budget accordingly. Consider overall insurance costs as well.

### Is it safe to drive at night?

Due to mountainous curves, limited lighting in rural areas, and animals crossing roadways, driving beyond urban centers at night is not recommended. Plan travel to avoid being on the roads after dark.

### What if I get into an accident?

Car accidents are common in Albania, so purchase full-coverage insurance with your rental to reduce financial risks. Legally, you must have third-party liability insurance at a minimum. If an accident happens, contact emergency services and follow rental company protocols.
