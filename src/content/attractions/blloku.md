A Secluded Past

Given its current vibe, it’s startling, but entering Blloku was strictly illegal for most citizens before 1991. Security checkpoints with soldiers carrying machine guns patrolled the area 24/7. Albania’s now most fashionable, progressive area only housed political elites in lavish villas behind walls and guards. The most imposing mansion was dictator Enver Hoxha’s, appearing modest next to typical despots’ grandiose digs. After Hoxha died and [communism crumbled](https://albaniavisit.com/the-fall-of-communism/), his estate became a children’s center while the district opened to public access.
