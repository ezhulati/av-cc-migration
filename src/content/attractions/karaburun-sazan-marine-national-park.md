A Haven for Marine Biodiversity

Outdoor enthusiasts, divers, and nature lovers will be amazed by this up-and-coming eco-tourism destination in the Mediterranean.

A Paradise for Marine Life

The crystal clear waters of the Karaburun-Sazan Marine National Park provide an ideal habitat for a vibrant array of marine species.

Over 12% of the Mediterranean’s flora and fauna call this park home. Underwater, there are 300+ fish species, sea turtles, seahorses, dolphins, and vibrant coral reefs. The biodiversity found here is unmatched in the Adriatic Sea.

Several conservation efforts help preserve the park’s fragile ecosystems. Fishing and development activities are restricted, allowing species to thrive.

Seeing endangered loggerhead sea turtles and rare corals up close is an unforgettable privilege. Visiting the park raises awareness of protecting marine biodiversity for future generations.

Dramatic Landscapes and Hidden Coves

The Karaburun Peninsula has stunning cliffs, beaches, and private swimming spots.

Hikers can explore trails with breathtaking views of the Adriatic Sea and mountains. Hidden coves and pristine beaches await discovery on Sazan Island.

The village of Kuc may provide a glimpse into traditional Albanian village life along the peninsula.

A boat trip around the peninsula reveals ancient castles, hidden caves, and a chance to spot dolphins. For nature lovers, the park’s landscapes are just as breathtaking as its marine life.

Practical Tips for Visiting

The best time to visit is May through October when the weather is ideal for marine activities. Late spring and early fall avoid peak tourist crowds.

Scuba divers can access dive sites through allowed dive centers in Vlora. Snorkeling, kayaking, and boat tours are other popular activities. Hikers should wear sturdy shoes for coastal trails.

Accommodation ranges from hotels in Vlora to campgrounds and village homestays. The coastal village of Borsh is a base to explore Sazan Island. Renting a car allows access to trailheads.

Albania’s Karaburun-Sazan Marine National Park visitors can admire the Adriatic’s wild beauty.

The display of Albania’s ecological wonders is helping it become a popular sustainable travel spot.
