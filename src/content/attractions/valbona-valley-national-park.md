Hiking in Albania’s Untamed NorthIn the Wild North

In the far reaches of northern Albania, where mountains rise like stone cathedrals and rivers twist through pine-forested valleys, lies Valbona Valley National Park. It’s not marked by luxury resorts or tour buses. It’s raw, towering, and stunningly quiet.

Valbona is one of Europe’s last wild hiking corridors—an 80-square-kilometer landscape where ancient trails pass through remote alpine villages, and the culture remains as preserved as the forest canopy above.

For travelers seeking immersion over amenities, this is the place.

It winds through ancient pine forests, crosses rocky ridgelines, and opens into panoramic views over both valleys. Most travelers use a ferry to get into Valbona, then hike over the pass into Theth the next day.

Shorter Walks & Local Spots

Best Time to Visit

Late May through early October is the optimal hiking season. Snow can linger in June, and October brings colder nights. Guesthouses are typically open from mid-May to early fall.

Pack for shifting weather, bring offline maps, and carry cash—there are no ATMs in the valley.
