Introduction

Along the Adriatic and Ionian seas lies a coastal gem waiting to be discovered.

Albania’s pristine 362-kilometer shoreline offers an affordable, crowd-free beach escape with unspoiled charm.

With stunning beaches, ancient ruins, delectable cuisine, and thrilling outdoor adventures, Albania’s coast promises an authentic Mediterranean experience.

When to Go

The best time to explore Albania’s coastline is from May to September, when the weather is warm and sunny.

Peak season falls in July and August, so if you prefer fewer crowds and lower prices, consider visiting in May, June, or September.

The shoulder months offer a pleasant climate and a more relaxed atmosphere, allowing you to immerse yourself in the beauty of Albania’s coast fully.

Getting There

When planning your trip to Albania’s coastline, you have two main options for arrival, depending on which part of the coast you intend to explore.

Flying into Tirana

Flying into **[Tirana International Airport](https://albaniavisit.com/travel-guide/tirana-international-airport/)** is the most convenient choice if you focus on the northern coastal towns, such as Shengjin, Golem, or Durres.

**[Tirana](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/tirana/)**, Albania’s capital, is well-connected to major European cities and serves as the country’s main gateway.

From the airport, you can easily **[rent a car](https://albaniavisit.com/cars/rental-cars/)**, **[take a taxi](https://albaniavisit.com/cars/transfers/)**, or **[hop on a bus](https://albaniavisit.com/bus/tirana-to-saranda/)** to reach your desired coastal destination.

Flying into Corfu, Greece

For the **[Albanian Riviera](https://albaniavisit.com/attractions/albanian-riviera/)** in the south, you have an additional option to save time and offer a unique travel experience.

Instead of flying into Tirana, you can fly into Corfu, Greece, and take a short **[ferry ride](https://albaniavisit.com/travel-guide/ferry-services/)** across the Ionian Sea to **[Saranda](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/saranda/)**, Albania.

The ferry journey takes approximately 45 minutes and runs regularly during summer.

Upon arrival in Saranda, you can **[rent a car](https://albaniavisit.com/travel-guide/rental-car-albania/)** at the port, **[hire a private driver](https://albaniavisit.com/cars/transfers/)**, or **[take a bus](https://albaniavisit.com/bus/tirana-to-saranda/)** to popular spots along the Albanian Riviera.

Upon arrival in Saranda, **[renting a car](https://albaniavisit.com/travel-guide/rental-car-albania/)** is the most convenient and cost-effective way to explore the surrounding areas.

Having a vehicle lets you discover the Albanian Riviera’s stunning coastal routes at your own pace. Car rental agencies are available inside the port of Saranda.

You can rent a car, hire a private driver, or take local buses to popular spots along the Albanian Riviera.

One significant advantage of flying into Corfu and taking the ferry to Saranda is avoiding the scenic but lengthy drive along the Llogara Pass mountain range.

While this route offers breathtaking views, it can be time-consuming and challenging.

A tunnel is currently being constructed to bypass this mountain pass and shorten the driving time, but it is not yet open to the public.

Where to Stay

Albania’s coastline caters to every traveler’s needs, offering diverse accommodation options.

Luxury seekers can indulge in upscale resorts with top-notch amenities and breathtaking sea views.

For a more intimate experience, opt for a boutique hotel or a charming family-run guesthouse, where you can immerse yourself in the local hospitality and culture.

Budget-conscious travelers will find plenty of affordable hostels and apartments that provide a comfortable base for exploring the coast.

Regardless of your preference, booking your accommodation well in advance, especially during the peak summer months, is advisable to secure your desired location and avoid disappointment.

Practical Information and Tips

**Currency**: The local currency is the Albanian lek. While some larger hotels and restaurants may accept credit cards, carrying cash for smaller purchases and tips is always a good idea. ATMs are widely available in larger towns and cities, but having some cash on hand is advisable when exploring more remote areas.

**Language**: While Albanian is the official language, many people in the tourism industry speak English, Italian, or Greek. However, learning a few basic phrases in Albanian, such as “hello” (përshëndetje) and “thank you” (faleminderit), can go a long way in showing your appreciation for the local culture.

**Transportation**: Renting a car is recommended for exploring Albania’s coast, as it provides the most flexibility and freedom to discover the region at your own pace. It’s more economical than hiring a private driver or relying on taxis and more reliable than buses, which can be cramped and difficult to navigate. Albania has a well-maintained network of roads connecting the main towns and cities, but be prepared for some winding and narrow routes, especially in more remote areas. If you prefer not to drive, local buses and taxis are available, and many coastal towns are compact enough to explore on foot or by bicycle.

**Safety**: Albania is generally a safe country for tourists. As with any destination, it’s important to exercise common sense and take basic precautions, such as keeping an eye on your belongings in crowded areas and being aware of your surroundings, especially at night.

**Guided Tours**: To make the most of your visit, consider joining a guided tour or hiring a local guide. These experts can provide valuable insights into Albania’s history, culture, and natural wonders and take you to hidden spots you might not discover alone. From hiking and kayaking tours to cultural and culinary experiences, plenty of options suit every interest and budget.
