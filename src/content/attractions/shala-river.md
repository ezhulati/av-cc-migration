Why Visit

The Shala River is celebrated for its vibrant, azure colors that resemble tropical waters more than a European river. The river’s source in the mountains provides chilled, clean meltwater cascading through limestone gorges. The striking contrast of the vivid waters against the lush green slopes is an incredible sight.

Adventure Activities

The river’s prime location in the heart of the Albanian Alps makes it a mecca for adventure lovers. Brave the chilling snowmelt waters for an exhilarating dip in the river’s pools and waterfalls. Guided rafting and kayaking tours allow you to tackle the Shala’s rapids and cascades for an adrenaline rush. Full-day rafting trips typically range from €50-70 per person, including transportation.

Boat Tours

A scenic and relaxing way to experience the Shala River is by booking a boat tour from nearby Komani Lake. These guided tours last 1-2 hours, taking visitors along the turquoise waters while stopping for swimming and photos. Some tours even continue to the mouth of the river. The Shala River boat trip costs approximately €25 per person and runs daily from mid-May through early November. Departure is usually around 9:30 am from Komani Lake.

When to Visit

The best time to visit the Shala River is from May through September when the water levels are highest. Summertime is peak season, so book Shala boat tours well in advance. Multi-day tours are also available, allowing you to spend several nights camping along the banks. Be prepared for changeable water levels depending on snowmelt and rainfall.

Getting There

The Shala River area can be accessed via guided boat tours from Komani Lake or by shuttle from lakeside guesthouses. Multi-day tours from Tirana, Shkoder, and Valbona often include time at the Shala River as part of the itinerary. Renting a car is also an option, but prepare for rough, unpaved roads on the 55km drive from Shkodra.

Plan Your Adventure

Let the Shala River transport you to a world of turquoise waters, adventure thrills, and relaxation surrounded by Albania’s soaring peaks and emerald forests. Its unspoiled beauty promises an unforgettable summer memory.
