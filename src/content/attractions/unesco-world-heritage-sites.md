Journey Into the Past

First is the ancient city of Butrint, a living relic bearing traces of the many civilizations that have graced its lands over the millennia.

Next are the historic cities of Berat and Gjirokastra, exemplifying architectural brilliance as they preserve Albania’s Ottoman heritage.

Then there’s the pristine million-year-old Lake Ohrid region, a harmonious blend of natural beauty and human history along the Albanian-Macedonian border.

Finally, we’ll explore the ancient and primeval beech forests, which provide a sanctuary of biodiversity and natural beauty within their quiet mountain valleys.

Butrint – A Window to Albania’s Ancient Past

On a tranquil hillside overlooking the Vivari Channel, [Butrint](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/butrint/) offers 2,500 years of history in one magical spot.

Walking among the evocative ruins, you can almost hear echoes of the Greeks, [Romans](https://albaniavisit.com/albanias-roman-era/), [Byzantines](https://albaniavisit.com/byzantine-era-albania/), and [Ottomans](https://albaniavisit.com/albania-under-ottoman-rule/) who once called Butrint home.

The site invites you to immerse yourself in each era. Climb to the top rows of the 3rd century BC theatre for panoramic views.

Stroll through the intricate mosaic floors of a 6th-century basilica.

Reflected in the paleochristian baptistry that later became part of a church.

Don’t miss the medieval castle and defense tower from Butrint’s Venetian period.

Butrint encapsulates Albania’s layered history, earning its place as the country’s first UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992.

Berat – The City of a Thousand Windows

The alluring hillside town of [Berat](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/berat/) transports you to Albania’s Ottoman past.

Its remarkably intact architecture earned it UNESCO World Heritage status in 2005, together with Gjirokastra.

In Berat, the white-walled Mangalem neighborhood clusters around the 15th-century Sultan’s Mosque next to the Osum River.

Don’t miss the seven-arched Gorica Bridge spanning the river, built in the 14th century.

Just beyond lies the ancient hilltop citadel gazing down over red-tiled roofs.

Exploring the cobbled lanes of Berat’s historic quarters reveals the enduring beauty of craftsmanship from centuries past.

The Stone City of Gjirokastra

One of my favorite cities in Albania and my grandmother’s hometown, [Gjirokastra](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/gjirokaster/), hides its Ottoman-era treasures behind an imposing hillside fortress.

Its formidable yet elegant citadel earned it UNESCO recognition alongside Berat in 2005.

Inside the fortress walls, discover a centuries-old bazaar and 18th-century church.

The audacious location makes the castle visible throughout the town below.

The Natural and Cultural Heritage of the Ohrid Region

Few settings rival the crystalline blue waters of [Lake Ohrid](https://albaniavisit.com/attractions/lake-ohrid/), shared between Albania and North Macedonia.

This pristine lake has supported over 200 species of plants and animals since ancient times, earning its UNESCO recognition.

Moreover, the area around Ohrid formed an important crossroads between civilizations for millennia.

The region around Pogradec in Albania was [inhabited by Illyrians](https://albaniavisit.com/prehistory-albania/) in the 5th century BC, [followed by Romans](https://albaniavisit.com/albanias-roman-era/) along the Via Egnatia trade route.

The ruins of a paleo-Christian church and floor mosaics point to the spread of early Christianity here.

The later growth of [Pogradec](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/pogradec/) in the 19th and 20th centuries showcases Albanian vernacular architecture.

On the Macedonian side, don’t miss the 10th-century St. Naum Monastery.

Lush beech forests once dominated Europe’s landscape before industrialization.

Fortunately, Albania still harbors pockets of ancient beech woodlands in the mountain ranges bordering Montenegro and Macedonia.

The Gashi River valley in Albania’s Tropojë district contains magnificent beech forests untouched for millennia.

These secluded woodlands protect rare flora and fauna, while revealing the expansive history of primeval forests across Europe.
