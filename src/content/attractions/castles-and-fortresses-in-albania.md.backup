Historic Architecture

With over 158 castles and fortresses dotting its rugged landscape, Albania offers history lovers and architecture aficionados a captivating journey into the past.

The castles and fortresses of Albania provide a glimpse into the tumultuous past of invasions, sieges, and battles for control throughout Albania’s history.

Albania’s castles and fortresses are historically and culturally significant, from ancient Illyrian hill forts to medieval castles to Ottoman-era fortifications.

This article will explore some of Albania’s most magnificent and important castles and fortresses.

Krujë Castle

One of Albania’s most significant and impressive castles is Krujë Castle, located in the historic town of Krujë.

Perched atop a steep hill rising 557 meters above sea level, Krujë Castle provides sweeping views of the surrounding landscape and once controlled an important route through Albania.

The castle dates back to the 5th century AD, built as an Illyrian fortification.

Later, it expanded in the Middle Ages and achieved the greatest prominence as the center of the Albanian resistance against the Ottoman Empire, led by the legendary hero Skanderbeg in the 15th century.

Skanderbeg used the castle as his base of operations and successfully kept the Ottoman armies from fully conquering Albania for decades.

Within the sprawling castle complex covering over 5 hectares, visitors can explore Skanderbeg’s museum, exhibiting artifacts from the time period and ruins of a Byzantine-era church, mosque, and clock tower.

The outer defensive walls snake along the hill’s contours, providing a forbidding sight for potential invaders.

Krujë Castle stands as a proud monument to the spirit of Albanian independence and resilience.

Berat Castle

Berat, situated along the Osum River, is home to another majestic fortress – Berat Castle.

Known as the “City of a Thousand Windows,” [Berat Castle](https://albaniavisit.com/attractions/berat-castle/) exemplifies the unique defensive architecture and construction techniques developed in Albania over the centuries.

The castle dates back to the 4th century BC when the Illyrians built the first fortress on the site. Its strategic location on a rocky hill overlooking a river valley called for the constructing of a citadel.

Over time, the Byzantines expanded and fortified the castle in the 13th century and the Ottomans in the 15th century.

Within the castle walls, a quaint medieval town flourished with churches, mosques, houses, and other structures tightly packed together.

What makes Berat Castle so instantly recognizable are the white structures crowding the hillside, punctuated by windows of all different sizes and orientations.

These windows visually represent the fusion of Christian and Muslim architecture within the castle complex.

Visitors to Berat Castle can get lost wandering through its cobbled streets and exploring the Greek Orthodox Onufri Museum, which exhibits precious Byzantine-style iconography.

Gjirokastër Fortress

The city of Gjirokastër is like an open-air museum defined by its wealth of Ottoman-era homes, commercial buildings, churches, and, of course, its dominating fortress perched atop a hill overlooking the Drino Valley.

This formidable fortress, dating back to the 12th century, attained its current form during renovations undertaken in the early 19th century.

Its position strategically overlooking a main route through the valley demonstrates the defensive ingenuity of Albanian castle construction.

Within the fortress walls, visitors can check out the new “Cold War Tunnel,” which served as a secret bunker during the Communist era, along with the National Museum of Weapons showcasing Albania’s various armaments throughout history.

Walking along the rugged fortress walls provides beautiful views of red-tiled roofs and white limestone architecture that earned Gjirokastër the nickname “City of Stone.”

Gjirokastër Fortress remains one of the country’s top tourist attractions and architectural marvels.

Rozafa Castle

Situated high above the city of Shkodër in northern Albania stands the ancient fortress of Rozafa.

The earliest signs of fortified settlements in this strategic location date back to antiquity when the Illyrians constructed the first defensive walls.

The Romans expanded the fortifications after defeating the Illyrians in 167 BC.

The Byzantines and Venetians later controlled Rozafa before falling under Ottoman rule for five centuries.

The castle complex sprawls across the rocky slopes, containing ruins of ramparts, cisterns, terraces, and a church.

The site is named after the legendary Rozafa, who was walled into the ramparts as an offering to the gods so that the castle’s construction could be completed.

This tragic tale of sacrifice has become integral to Albanian culture and folklore.

Rozafa Castle’s strategic position overlooking two rivers and controlling key trade routes shows why it was so fiercely contested throughout history.

Today, visitors can enjoy breathtaking views from Rozafa’s ramparts and learn about the artifacts uncovered, indicating the site’s long timeline of human activity.

Bashtovë Fortress

The early 15th century Bashtovë Fortress provides a classic example of Albanian medieval military architecture.

Bashtovë served as an important defensive fortification for the Principality of Albania until it fell to the Ottomans in 1417.

The castle complex contains a variety of structures enclosed within three defensive walls.

The outermost walls protected the peasants and their livestock, while the inner walls safeguarded noble families and rulers.

Visitors can explore the ruins of a small chapel, water cisterns, and residential quarters within the walls.

Archeological excavations have uncovered ceramic vessels, cooking utensils, jewelry, armaments, and coins, providing insight into daily life at the fortress through the centuries.

The site offers awe-inspiring views over the plains below and the Adriatic Sea.

The highly strategic location of Bashtovë Fortress illustrates why control over this area was so heavily contested.

Petrelë Castle

Rising spectacularly on a rocky hill in central Albania, Petrelë Castle is a stunning example of medieval defensive architecture.

The first structures erected on the hilltop date back to Justinian I in the 6th century AD.

Later in the 14th century, Petrelë Castle was expanded and solidified by Albanian nobleman Petrela, indicating the growing importance and prosperity of the region.

The castle complex is characterized by substantial walls following the natural contours of the terrain interspersed with round towers.

Visitors can explore the ruins of a chapel, water cisterns, barracks, and noble residences within the walls.

Porto Palermo Castle

On the Ionian Sea in southern Albania, [Porto Palermo Castle](https://albaniavisit.com/attractions/porto-palermo-castle/) makes for a picturesque scene with its tidy triangular shape surrounded on three sides by azure water.

The small coastal castle just south of Himara was constructed in the early 19th century by Ali Pasha of Tepelena, the powerful Ottoman Albanian ruler.

Ali Pasha controlled a semi-autonomous territory encompassing much of southern and central Albania.

Within the compact triangular walls, visitors can tour Ali Pasha’s small private hammam along with British-constructed bunkers and tunnels from the Second World War when the area was occupied.

Prezë Castle

Found atop a commanding hill in south-central Albania, Prezë Castle was constructed in the second half of the 14th century as a stronghold for the Thopia family, who ruled over the area.

The Thopia were one of the Late Middle Ages’s most powerful Albanian feudal families, controlling a territory focused around the inland town of Berat.

The fortified castle complex follows an irregular oval layout with round towers offering visibility across the landscape.

Within the roughly one-meter-thick defensive walls, the ruins of a small Byzantine church and watchtowers are still visible today.

Fine pottery artifacts and metal weapons have been unearthed at the site.

Prezë Castle was one of several strongholds owned by the Thopia dynasty used to exert control and amass wealth from the territory.

The castle changed hands several times before ultimately falling into Ottoman hands for good in the 15th century.

Exploring Prezë Castle provides insight into the political dynamics between competing Albanian noble families during the Late Middle Ages as they attempted to gain power and autonomy.

Lëkurësi Castle

Found along the Albanian Riviera in the southernmost region of the country sits Lëkurësi Castle, strategically positioned overlooking Sarandë Bay.

The castle was constructed in 1537 during the Ottoman Empire’s southward expansion under Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent.

The aim was to establish a stronghold from which the Ottomans could launch naval attacks against Western powers based across the straits in Corfu and southern Italy.

Lëkurësi Castle has a tidy rectangular-shaped design with imposing high walls and several towers at the corners.

Within the walls, structures were built for military functions, including a mosque, water cisterns, barracks, and gunpowder storage rooms.

Rodoni originates from ancient times when the Illyrians constructed the first walls and towers during the 4th century BCE.

The castle occupies a highly strategic position overlooking a main sea channel.

The Romans, Byzantines, and Venetians occupied and refortified the castle throughout different eras.

The core elements of the castle complex include a triangular keep with imposing 50-foot walls and several defensive towers added by the Venetians in the 16th century.

Sections of the exterior walls and towers are still intact, showcasing various architectural styles reflecting the site’s complex, layered history.

Archeological excavations have revealed Illyrian fortification walls and evidence of early Christian activity.

Rodoni Castle is situated in one of Albania’s most hotly contested regions near the port city of Durrës.

Controlling passage through the straits was a priority for regional powers throughout history.

Visitors can explore the rugged ruins and take in views of the sea channel that was so heavily fought over.

Lezhë Castle

Found in the ancient town of Lezhë in northwest Albania, the first foundations of Lezhë Castle were built as an Illyrian hill fort settlement as far back as the 8th century BCE.

The strategic value of the site overlooking hilly terrain and the Drin River Valley made it an ideal spot for a citadel.

The fortifications were later expanded substantially under the rule of the Byzantine Empire in the Middle Ages and termed the “Red Castle.”

Within the sprawling castle walls, visitors can view the medieval church ruins and defensive walls snaking along the rugged contours of the hill.

Archeological digs have uncovered tombs, housing structures, water cisterns, tiles, and ceramics, shedding light on over two thousand years of habitation at the site.

The castle’s sheer size and scale reflect Lezhë’s political importance during the Middle Ages as a center of power and commerce.

Over the centuries, possession of Lezhë Castle was contested by the Byzantines, Venetians, Bulgarians, Normans, and Ottomans until the ultimate Ottoman triumph.

Today, visitors can take in the sweeping views from the hilltop castle as they reflect on Lezhë’s strategic value that led generations of powers to fight for its control.

Kaninë Castle

Found dramatically on a remote hilltop in southwestern Albania, Kaninë Castle is a majestic medieval-era fortress offering incredible vistas over the Vlorë region and the Adriatic Sea.

Kaninë Castle was built in the 6th century during the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I.

Its elevated position provided military-strategic advantages and visibility over the surrounding territory.

The castle complex follows an irregular oval shape with imposing defensive walls and towers occupying the highest sections of the rocky hill.

Inside the castle walls, archeologists have uncovered water cisterns, ceramic fragments, and ruins of a small Byzantine church and housing structures.

Kaninë Castle represented a crucial stronghold for controlling the Vlorë region and access to the Adriatic.

Over the centuries, the castle changed hands between the Byzantines, Bulgarians, Venetians, and Ottomans, each undertaking renovations and enhancements.

The castle remains remarkably intact today, offering visitors panoramic sea views from its windswept ruins.

Kaninë Castle’s rugged natural beauty and rich history make it one of Albania’s must-see fortifications.

Elbasan Castle

The medieval fortress perimeter walls engulfing the historic city of Elbasan in central Albania rank as one of the largest castle complexes in southeastern Europe, encompassing over 25 hectares.

Elbasan Castle was originally constructed during the Middle Ages after the area fell under Byzantine control following attacks by Bulgarian and Norman forces intent on controlling the region.

The massive crenelated walls protected Elbasan, which became an important trading and military outpost.

Within the walls, generations of houses, churches, mosques, marketplaces, and streets have been constructed alongside the ruins of ancient towers and fortifications.

The castle walls have largely dictated the layout of the sprawling city, which has thrived inside its protective embrace.

Visitors to Elbasan can walk sections of the expansive castle walls as they take in views overlooking the Shkumbin River Valley.

Elbasan Castle represents a prime example of how Albanian cities were heavily fortified for defensive purposes during the medieval period.
