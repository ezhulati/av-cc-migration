Guide to the Vjosa River in Albania

The Vjosa River flows untamed through southern Albania, cutting through canyons and gravel islands, with clear waters and a landscape that remains largely untouched by development. Still unknown to most travelers, it offers a rare experience in Europe.

Designated as [Europe‚Äôs first Wild River National Park](https://www.vjosanationalpark.al/) in March 2023, this 190-kilometer waterway flows freely from Greece to the Adriatic Sea, creating a paradise for outdoor enthusiasts and cultural explorers alike. Whether you‚Äôre seeking [adrenaline-pumping rafting](https://albaniavisit.com/activities/rafting/), soothing thermal springs, or immersion in traditional Albanian culture, this comprehensive guide provides everything you need to transform your Vjosa River dreams into reality.

Getting to the Vjosa River

The journey to the Vjosa begins at [Tirana International Airport (TIA)](https://albaniavisit.com/travel-guide/tirana-international-airport/), Albania‚Äôs main gateway. From the airport, you have several transport options to reach the river towns of P√´rmet and Tepelene, the two primary bases for Vjosa exploration.

### ‚úàÔ∏è Find the Best Flights to Albania

Albania is closer than you think. Use the tool below to compare flights to Tirana International Airport (TIA) from your city‚Äîthen start planning your escape to the mountains.

üí° **Pro Tip:** Tuesday and Wednesday departures typically offer the best prices to Tirana

[Airport to Tirana City](https://albaniavisit.com/cars/transfers/)

Take the Rinas Express bus (300 ALL/‚Ç¨2.50, hourly 6:00-18:00) or LU-NA shuttle (400 ALL/‚Ç¨3.50, 24/7 service) to reach the city center.

Official taxis cost around 2,500 ALL (‚Ç¨20-25).

[By Bus](https://albaniavisit.com/bus)

From Tirana‚Äôs North/South Terminal, take the direct daily bus to P√´rmet (4h 36m, ‚Ç¨18).

For Tepelene, take buses via Fier (1,000-1,500 ALL/‚Ç¨8-12, 3-4 hours with connections).

Most intercity buses depart before 18:30, so plan accordingly.

When to Visit

The Vjosa offers distinct experiences throughout the year, with **April-June and September-October** providing the ideal balance of weather, water levels, and tourist numbers.

**Spring (April-June)** brings the river to life with snowmelt creating perfect rafting conditions. Wildflowers bloom across the valley, temperatures range from 15-25¬∞C, and you‚Äôll encounter fewer tourists. This period offers Class II-III rapids at their most exciting levels, making it the prime season for adventure seekers.

**Summer (July-August)** sees peak tourist numbers and temperatures soaring to 25-35¬∞C. While the heat can be oppressive for hiking, lower water levels make the river more family-friendly for swimming and gentle rafting. Thermal springs become crowded, especially on weekends.

**Autumn (September-October)** delivers perhaps the best overall conditions with comfortable temperatures (20-28¬∞C), harvest season festivities, and spectacular fall colors. Water levels remain suitable for most activities while crowds thin considerably.

**Winter (November-March)** finds many tourism businesses closed, with cold, wet weather limiting outdoor activities. However, budget travelers will find the lowest prices and ultimate solitude.

Thermal Springs and Relaxation

[Benja Thermal Springs](https://albaniavisit.com/attractions/benja-thermal-baths/) remain the region‚Äôs most famous attraction, located 13km from P√´rmet within Fir of Hotova-Dang√´lli National Park. These eight natural sulfur springs (four on each riverbank) maintain temperatures of 22-28¬∞C year-round. Despite the ‚Äúthermal‚Äù name, the water is lukewarm rather than hot, but therapeutic properties treat rheumatism, skin conditions, and respiratory issues.

Access is completely free, though facilities remain minimal‚Äîbasic toilets were under construction as of 2024-2025. Arrive before 9 AM or near sunset to avoid summer crowds, and walk 200m upstream from the main bridge pool to find quieter spots. Bring towels, water shoes, sun protection, and snacks, as vendor availability varies by season.

For a less crowded alternative, Sarandaporo Thermal Springs near Leskovik offers warmer waters (29-40¬∞C) including a medicinal sulfur cave, accessed via a wide dirt road along the Vjosa.

Cultural Explorations

Fishing and Photography

The upper Vjosa sections near the Greek border offer excellent fly fishing for brown and rainbow trout, with the best conditions from May-July. While regulations remain minimal, hiring local guides ensures access to prime spots and sustainable practices.

Photographers will find endless opportunities, from the elevated perspectives at Tepelene Castle to river-level reflections during golden hour. The dramatic S-curve viewpoint near [P√´rmet](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/permet/) delivers postcard-perfect shots, especially with winter‚Äôs snow-capped mountain backdrop.

Practical Details for Your VisitWhat to Pack

For thermal springs, bring quick-dry towels, water shoes, waterproof bags, two sets of swimwear, and reef-safe sunscreen. Hiking requires broken-in boots, moisture-wicking layers, rain gear, and a 30-40L daypack. Don‚Äôt forget a headlamp, portable charger, and insect repellent with 20% Picaridin.

General items should include sturdy walking shoes for uneven surfaces, a packable umbrella, European plug adapters (Type C/F), and photocopies of your passport. A basic first-aid kit with stomach remedies proves invaluable when trying rich Albanian cuisine.

Money Matters

While the Albanian Lek (ALL) serves as [official currency](https://albaniavisit.com/travel-guide/currency-lek/), euros are widely accepted in tourist areas at roughly 100 ALL = ‚Ç¨1. ATMs in P√´rmet and Tepelene dispense cash with 4-7‚Ç¨ fees per withdrawal and 75,000-100,000 ALL transaction limits. BKT Bank ATMs don‚Äôt charge local fees, making them the best option for multiple withdrawals.

Credit cards work in larger hotels and upscale restaurants, but Albania remains largely cash-based. Budget ‚Ç¨30-50 per person daily including accommodation, with restaurant meals costing ‚Ç¨8-15, coffee ‚Ç¨1-2, and local beer ‚Ç¨2-3.

Language and Communication

Essential [Albanian phrases](https://albaniavisit.com/travel-guide/albanian-words-phrases-for-tourists/) will enhance your experience:

**P√´rsh√´ndetje** (per-shen-DET-ye) ‚Äì hello

**Faleminderit** (fah-leh-min-deh-REET) ‚Äì thank you

**Sa kushton kjo?** (sah koosh-TONE kyoh) asks ‚Äúhow much?‚Äù

Remember that Albanians shake their heads for ‚Äúyes‚Äù and nod for ‚Äúno‚Äù‚Äîthe opposite of most cultures!

English proficiency reaches about 40% among younger people and tourism workers, with Italian widely understood due to historical connections.

Download Google Translate‚Äôs offline Albanian package and use the camera function for menus and signs.

For connectivity, [purchase a tourist eSIM](https://albaniavisit.com/travel-guide/best-esim-albania/). Networks provide excellent 4G coverage throughout the Vjosa region, though some canyon areas have dead zones.

Save room for gliko, P√´rmet‚Äôs famous preserved fruits, and trilece three-milk cake. Wash it down with raki (fruit brandy) or local wines, toasting with G√´zuar! (cheers).

Safety and Health

Albania ranks among [Europe‚Äôs safest countries](https://albaniavisit.com/travel-guide/albania-safety-statistics-for-tourists/), with petty theft in crowded areas the only notable concern. Medical facilities in P√´rmet and Tepelene provide basic care, with pharmacies stocking common medications. Emergency numbers include 112 (general), 127 (ambulance), and 129 (police).

Pack anti-diarrheal medication, pain relievers, and any prescription drugs you need. Tap water is generally safe, though bottled water prevents stomach issues from dietary changes. When rafting, use only Albanian Rafting Federation licensed operators‚Äîsome unlicensed companies pose serious safety risks.
