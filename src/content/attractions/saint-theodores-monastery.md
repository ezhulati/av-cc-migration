Explore Five Centuries of History

Most people drive right past the tiny sign for “Manastiri i Shen Theodhorit” without a second thought. They’re focused on getting to the beach, not exploring some old monastery ruins. But they’re missing one of the Albanian coast’s most bizarre stories – a place that’s been an ancient temple, Orthodox monastery, Soviet navy vacation spot, and Albanian army base, all perched on the same dramatic hilltop.

Getting there requires commitment. After you spot that easy-to-miss sign on the coastal highway, you drive up a narrow single-lane road that winds through olive groves for about 2.5 kilometers. The parking area costs 200-300 LEK (around €2-3), and from there it’s a 10-15 minute walk up a recently paved stone path to reach the monastery gates.

Don’t expect a polished tourist attraction. As of 2024, visitors describe the place as “mostly looking like a construction site.” There’s scaffolding, building materials scattered around, and the ongoing restoration work can be pretty chaotic. But that’s part of what makes it interesting – you’re seeing a 600-year-old site being slowly brought back to life.

The monastery sits exactly where an ancient temple to Zeus and Artemis once stood. This wasn’t accidental – early Christians had a thing for taking over pagan sacred sites and flipping them to their own purposes. Something about claiming spiritual territory and showing the old gods who’s boss now.

Construction started sometime in the 14th century and didn’t stop for nearly 500 years. Think about that – generations of monks, [Ottoman rulers](https://albaniavisit.com/albania-under-ottoman-rule/), and local villagers all contributed to building this place over centuries. The final major reconstruction happened in 1882, which is when the monastery got its current appearance.

The building style is classic [Albanian-Byzantine](https://albaniavisit.com/byzantine-era-albania/): clausonage construction with alternating courses of slim bricks and local limestone, topped with wooden roofs instead of the stone vaulting you see in bigger Byzantine churches. It’s built for the local climate and materials, not to impress Constantinople.

The layout follows typical Orthodox monastery design – central church surrounded by monastic cells and service buildings, all enclosed within protective walls. The whole complex is roughly polygonal, adapting to the hilltop’s natural shape rather than forcing some geometric perfection.

From Monastery to Soviet Resort![](/images/destinations/Saint_Theodore_Monastery_144820159.jpeg)

Here’s where the story gets weird. In 1946, Albania’s new communist regime shut down all religious institutions, and Saint Theodore’s became just another abandoned building. But in 1952, something unexpected happened – the Soviets turned it into holiday homes for Russian navy officers.

The Pashaliman naval base near [Orikum](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/orikum/) was the Soviet Union’s only Mediterranean facility, housing submarines that were crucial to Cold War strategy. Apparently, those submarine commanders needed somewhere nice to relax between missions, and a monastery with sea views fit the bill perfectly.

This lasted until 1962, when Albania’s paranoid dictator Enver Hoxha had his famous falling-out with the Soviets and kicked them all out. The monastery then became an Albanian army observation post, which it remained until [communism collapsed](https://albaniavisit.com/the-fall-of-communism/) in 1991.

You can still see evidence of this military period – soldiers’ graffiti on walls, old military debris that workers are still clearing out, and the concrete bunkers scattered around the area. It’s a bizarre archaeological layer cake of Orthodox Christianity, Soviet strategy, and Albanian paranoia all mixed together.

The Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania has been working to restore the monastery since the late 2010s, part of their massive effort to rebuild over 250 churches destroyed or damaged during the communist era. The church structure is mostly complete now, and several of the residential buildings have new roofs and walls.

But “restored” is a relative term. The courtyard is accessible when the gate’s open (which isn’t always), but most of the interior spaces are still off-limits. The church itself is usually locked, though you can peek through doorways and catch glimpses of one surviving ancient fresco on the interior wall.

The monastery offers free admission, though donations are encouraged. There are no formal opening hours, no visitor center, no information panels – just stone walls, ongoing construction, and spectacular views. It’s more like visiting an active archaeological site than a museum.

The best time to visit is spring or fall when the heat won’t kill you on the hike back up from the beach. Summer temperatures can hit 40°C, and that uphill climb in the blazing sun is no joke.

Most visitors combine the monastery with [Gjipe Beach](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/gjipe/), since the parking area serves as the trailhead for both. After checking out the monastery ruins, you can continue down a steep rocky path for 30-40 minutes to reach one of Albania’s most pristine beaches.

The monastery makes for a nice bookend to the beach experience – ancient stone walls and spiritual history above, crystal-clear water and limestone canyon below. It’s a weird juxtaposition that somehow works.

From the monastery’s terrace, you get panoramic views of the entire coast – the turquoise Ionian Sea, olive groves rolling down to the water, and Gjipe Canyon cutting dramatically through the landscape. On clear days, you can see all the way to the Greek island of Corfu.

Local folklore adds another layer to the monastery’s appeal. The sea cave directly below the cliffs – known as Pirate’s Cave – supposedly sheltered corsairs and smugglers in medieval times. The cave is only accessible by boat and becomes part of the monastery’s mystique: sacred space above, lawless hideout below.

There’s also the persistent legend about the ancient temple foundations. While there’s no visible evidence of Zeus and Artemis worship (probably buried under centuries of construction), the story speaks to something locals feel about the place – that this hilltop has been sacred for a very long time.

Manage your expectations. This isn’t Meteora or Mount Athos – it’s a partially restored construction site with amazing views and a fascinating backstory. You can wander the courtyard when it’s open, peek into some ground-floor rooms, and admire the rebuilt portions alongside the still-ruined sections.

The juxtaposition is striking: brand new stone walls next to crumbling medieval foundations, fresh roof tiles on buildings that were abandoned for decades, scaffolding supporting walls that survived everything from Ottoman rule to Soviet occupation.

Sometimes caretakers are present who might unlock the church, but don’t count on it. Sometimes the whole place is closed for construction work. It’s unpredictable, which is part of its charm if you’re feeling adventurous, part of its frustration if you’re on a tight schedule.

![](/images/attractions/Saint_Theodore_Monastery_143389723.jpeg)Why It Matters

Saint Theodore’s Monastery represents something unique on the Mediterranean coast – a place where 2,000 years of history are still visible in the stones. Ancient temple foundations, Byzantine construction techniques, Ottoman-era modifications, Soviet-era adaptations, and modern restoration efforts all exist in the same space.

It’s also a key part of the Dhërmi region’s identity. This area was once called “little Mount Athos” for its density of monasteries and churches. Most of those are gone now, making Saint Theodore’s one of the few surviving witnesses to the region’s deep Orthodox heritage.

The ongoing restoration ensures this remarkable site survives for future generations, even if the work is slow and sometimes chaotic. Better a construction site that preserves history than elegant ruins that crumble into nothing.

For visitors, it adds serious historical depth to what could otherwise be just another beach trip. After swimming in Gjipe’s crystal waters and exploring the canyon, you can climb back up and contemplate how this hilltop has sheltered ancient priests, Byzantine monks, Soviet naval officers, and Albanian soldiers – all drawn to the same strategic position overlooking one of the most beautiful stretches of coastline in the Mediterranean.

The monastery isn’t going anywhere. It survived 500 years of construction, Ottoman rule, communist persecution, and Soviet occupation. A little ongoing restoration work won’t stop it now.
