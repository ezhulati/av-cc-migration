Why Visit

At the center of [Tirana](https://albaniavisit.com/destinations/tirana/) lies Skanderbeg Square (Sheshi Skënderbej pronounced *SHEH-shee SKUHN-duhr-bay*), Albania’s most important public space. Spanning roughly 40,000 square meters, the square serves as a meeting ground for locals and a must-visit landmark for travelers exploring the capital.

Named after Gjergj Kastrioti “Skanderbeg” (pronounced: *JYERJ Kahs-tree-OH-tee*), the 15th-century Albanian hero who led [resistance against the Ottoman Empire](https://albaniavisit.com/albania-under-ottoman-rule/), the square embodies the nation’s enduring [spirit of independence](https://albaniavisit.com/albania-independence/). Today, it functions as the largest car-free plaza in the Balkans, surrounded by museums, monuments, and cultural institutions.

On any given day, you’ll find families strolling, children playing among the 100 fountain jets, and artists performing under the city lights. Whether you come for the architecture, history, or atmosphere, Skanderbeg Square is where Albania’s past and present meet.

The Heart of Tirana

The story of Skanderbeg Square reflects Tirana’s transformation over the last century.

**1917:** Austrian forces established the first public square during World War I.

**1920s–1930s:** Italian architects Armando Brasini and Florestano Di Fausto designed a European-style civic center.

**1939–1943:** Under Italian occupation, Gherardo Bosio reshaped the area with Rationalist and Fascist-era architecture.

**1950s–1980s:** The communist regime replaced the old bazaar with monumental buildings like the Palace of Culture and [National History Museum](https://albaniavisit.com/attractions/national-history-museum/), using the square for parades and rallies.

**1991:** Protesters gathered to topple the statue of dictator Enver Hoxha, marking Albania’s democratic transition.

**2017:** After years of traffic congestion, the Belgian firm 51N4E redesigned the square into a pedestrian-only space, earning the European Prize for Urban Public Space (2018).

Today’s Skanderbeg Square represents renewal—connecting layers of Albania’s history in a single, unified space.

The 2017 redesign emphasizes open space, accessibility, and symbolism. The paving stones were sourced from all regions of Albania, creating a mosaic that mirrors the country’s diversity. The plaza gently slopes upward toward the center—about two meters higher than its edges—with water trickling over its surface from an understated fountain.

Around the square, each building tells part of Albania’s story:

**Skanderbeg Monument (1968)** – Bronze equestrian statue honoring Albania’s national hero.

**Et’hem Bey Mosque (1790–1821)** – A rare Ottoman-era mosque, restored after decades of closure.

**Clock Tower (1828)** – Tirana’s historic symbol, offering panoramic city views.

**National History Museum (1981)** – Albania’s largest museum, recognizable by its mosaic mural *The Albanians*.

**Palace of Culture (1963)** – Houses the **National Opera and Ballet Theatre** and **National Library**.

**Bank of Albania (1938)** – Designed by Italian architects in Rationalist style, a hallmark of the occupation period.

**Tirana International Hotel (1979)** – Once the city’s tallest building, standing on the site of a demolished cathedral.

**Tirana City Hall** – Updated with a modern façade symbolizing Tirana’s contemporary shift.

Together, these landmarks form a circular showcase of Albania’s architectural evolution—from Ottoman heritage to socialist monumentalism and modern urban renewal.
