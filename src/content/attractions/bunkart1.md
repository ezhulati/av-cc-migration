The History of BUNK’ART

BUNK’ART, a five-floor underground bunker built by the communist government under dictator Enver Hoxha, has been transformed into a historical and art center that attracts tourists worldwide.

Inaugurated in June 1978 by Enver Hoxha himself, BUNK’ART was originally designed as an anti-nuclear bunker.

It was equipped with 106 rooms and an assembly hall, all meticulously planned to serve as a refuge for the country’s top officials in case of a nuclear attack.

The bunker’s passageways and rooms were considered the sleeping quarters for Hoxha and former Prime Minister Mehmet Shehu.

The Bunker as a Landmark

The bunker includes passageways and areas provided for the Army’s General Staff meetings in case of war.

It also contains rooms where it was thought the communist ex-dictator Enver Hoxha would sleep in case of a nuclear attack, as well as a gigantic hall dedicated to the meetings of the Political Bureau.

These spaces have been transformed into a video museum exhibition and art displays.
