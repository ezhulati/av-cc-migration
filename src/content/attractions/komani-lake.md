Why Visit

Formed in the late 1970s by damming the Drin River, this engineering marvel flooded the river valley, transforming it into one of Albania’s most jaw-dropping sights. With its emerald waters, sheer cliffs, and surrounding peaks, Komani Lake is a must-see for travelers venturing into the Albanian Alps region.

A ferry ride on Komani Lake is the highlight for most visitors. New vistas unfold around each bend as the boat navigates the twisting waters. One moment, steep slopes surround you blanketed in lush forests—the next, sheer rocky cliffs plunge dramatically straight into the lake’s vivid turquoise waters.

The Scenic Ferry Ride

This pristine habitat supports rich biodiversity, a birdwatcher’s paradise. Nature lovers can spot various species along the lakeshore and forests, while the clear waters are ideal for fishing and boating.

The Origins of Komani Lake

Scattered villages around the lake host community festivals and fishing events, allowing visitors to experience Albanian traditions and hospitality.

Engineering Meets Natural Beauty

While the area’s raw natural splendor is undisputed, Komani Lake actually owes its origins to a massive engineering project. In the late 1970s, the Communist government built the towering Komani Dam in order to generate much-needed hydroelectric power. At 115 meters tall and 285 meters wide, this feat of infrastructure ranks among Europe’s most significant dam projects. Once completed, the dam’s reservoir took over the river valleys, submerging them under the vivid blue-green waters.

Experiencing Traditional Village Life

Fast forward four decades and Komani Lake has become a recreational magnet, drawing visitors to its pristine vistas and adventures. The lake is surrounded by small villages, where traditional ways of life carry on. Stopping to explore these rural hamlets provides a window into Albanian culture.

Outdoor Activities on the Lake

Many visitors also rent kayaks or small boats to paddle along the calm waters. Thrill-seekers brave the cold temperatures for a refreshing swim surrounded by spectacular scenery. Anglers can try their luck fishing Komani Lake’s depths.

An Unforgettable Albanian Highlight

For some visitors, the lake is merely a transit point en route to iconic destinations like Valbona Valley National Park further north. Even if you’re passing through, a ferry ride on Komani Lake shouldn’t be missed. Gazing at the majestic mountains reflected in the vivid waters is an experience that will be permanently etched in your memory. Let the peaceful beauty of this Albanian wonder leave you awestruck, and you’ll understand why locals boast that it resembles the famous fjords of Norway.
