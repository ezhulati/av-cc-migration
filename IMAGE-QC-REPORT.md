---

## Remaining Issues

### üî¥ Broken Image References (346)

#### Issue Categories:

**1. Google Hash Filenames (30+ files)**
- Pattern: `AATXAJyURccqUA7sgVAGXqgOlD9xWjA5R6UfHWn1Z1Us96c64`
- Source: Google Photos/Maps embedded images
- Location: Mainly `accommodation/` content
- **Action Required:** These images need to be re-sourced from Google Photos or replaced

**2. Generic Placeholder Names (40+ files)**
- Pattern: `picture276.jpeg`, `photojpg645.jpeg`, `photo25.jpg`
- Source: Unnamed uploads from WordPress migration
- Location: Scattered across `accommodation/` and other content
- **Action Required:** Manual identification and replacement needed

**3. Missing Activity Images (10 files)**
Files with simple naming that should exist:
```
/images/activities/agrotourism.jpg         ‚Üí agrotourism.jpeg exists (extension mismatch)
/images/activities/cyclealbania.jpg        ‚Üí Missing
/images/activities/hikingtrekking.jpg      ‚Üí hiking-trekking.jpeg exists (naming mismatch)
/images/activities/historicalsites.jpg     ‚Üí Missing
/images/activities/mountainbiking.jpg      ‚Üí Missing
/images/activities/winetasting.jpg         ‚Üí wine-tasting.jpeg exists (naming mismatch)
```
**Action Required:** Simple file rename or extension change

**4. Missing Attraction Images (250+ files)**
Many attraction images referenced but not found:
```
/images/attractions/albanianriviera.jpg
/images/attractions/beratcastle.jpg
/images/attractions/ethembeymosque.jpg
... and 200+ more
```
**Action Required:** Download from WordPress or use similar named orphaned images

**5. Case Sensitivity / Naming Variations**
Examples found:
- Referenced: `ZoeHoraDhermi.jpg` ‚Üí Actual: `Zoe-Hora-Dhermi.jpg`
- Referenced: `GreatMosqueofDurres...scaled.jpeg` ‚Üí Actual: `Great-Mosque-of-Durres...scaled.jpeg`

---

### üîç Orphaned Images (6,436)

**83% of images on disk are not referenced** in any content file. This indicates:

1. **Potential Matches:** Many orphaned images may match broken references
2. **Unused Assets:** Migration brought over unused WordPress media
3. **Naming Issues:** Files exist but with different names than referenced

#### Orphaned Image Distribution:
```
/images/accommodation/   ‚Üí 5,000+ images
/images/attractions/     ‚Üí 800+ images
/images/destinations/    ‚Üí 400+ images
/images/activities/      ‚Üí 100+ images
/images/posts/          ‚Üí 50+ images
/images/pages/          ‚Üí 30+ images
```

**Action Required:** Review `data/manual-review-images.csv` for potential matches

---

## Actionable Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

**1. Fix Simple Extension/Naming Mismatches**
```bash
# Run this script to fix known simple cases
cd public/images/activities
mv agrotourism.jpeg agrotourism.jpg
mv hiking-trekking.jpeg hikingtrekking.jpg
mv wine-tasting.jpeg winetasting.jpg
```

**2. Review Manual Match CSV**
- Open: `data/manual-review-images.csv`
- 234 potential matches identified
- Review confidence level and apply fixes

**3. Handle Case-Sensitivity Issues**
```bash
# Example fixes for known cases
cd public/images/accommodation
mv Zoe-Hora-Dhermi.jpg ZoeHoraDhermi.jpg
mv Great-Mosque-of-Durres-or-Grand-Mosque-of-Durres-Fatih-Mosque--scaled.jpeg \
   GreatMosqueofDurresorGrandMosqueofDurresFatihMosquescaled.jpeg
```

### Short-term Actions (Priority 2)

**4. Source Missing Accommodation Images**
- Review `data/images-not-found.json`
- Filter for `accommodation/` entries
- Source from:
  - WordPress media library backup
  - Booking platform APIs (if applicable)
  - Google Photos links (for hash-named images)

**5. Source Missing Attraction Images**
Many attraction images follow predictable patterns:
- `albanianriviera.jpg` ‚Üí Search for similar in orphaned images
- Use fallback from `destinations/` or `activities/` folders
- Download from WordPress if still available

**6. Clean Up Orphaned Images**
After fixing all references:
```bash
# Generate list of still-orphaned images
node scripts/qc-broken-images.js

# Move orphaned images to archive folder
mkdir -p public/images/archive
# Move files listed as orphaned
```

### Long-term Actions (Priority 3)

**7. Implement Image Naming Convention**
```
Format: {location}-{description}-{number}.{ext}
Example: tirana-city-view-1.jpg
        berat-castle-sunset-2.jpg
```

**8. Create Image Management Guidelines**
- Always use descriptive filenames (no `picture123.jpg`)
- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Include location/subject in filename
- Maintain consistent aspect ratios
- Store source URLs in image metadata

**9. Setup Automated Monitoring**
Add to CI/CD pipeline:
```bash
# Pre-commit hook
npm run validate:images

# Pre-build check
npm run check:broken-images
```

## Technical Details

### QC Methodology

1. **Content Extraction:**
   - Scanned all `.md` files in `src/content/`
   - Extracted image references from:
     - YAML frontmatter (`featuredImage`, `image`, `images[]`)
     - Markdown syntax: `![alt](path)`
     - HTML tags: `<img src="path">`

2. **Image Validation:**
   - Checked physical file existence in `public/images/`
   - Case-sensitive path matching
   - Extension verification

3. **Orphan Detection:**
   - Listed all physical images
   - Cross-referenced with content references
   - Identified unreferenced files

### Common Patterns Found

**WordPress Migration Issues:**
```
Source: Google Photos embed
Result: Hash filename (AATXAJyUR...)
Fix: Re-source original image

Source: WordPress upload
Result: Generic name (picture123.jpeg)
Fix: Manual identification needed

Source: WordPress image variants
Result: Multiple sizes (-scaled, -1024x768, etc.)
Fix: Standardize on one size
```
